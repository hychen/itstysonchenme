Identity-Based Resource Access: All requests for file, network, or device access must originate from an agent with a verifiable identity and comply with its granted semantic permissions.

It handles agent lifecycle management, task assignment, and semantic-based behavior monitoring.\nSemantic Execution Layer for Enterprise Agents: Provides a standardized execution environment for AI agents from various sources. Regardless of whether the underlying model is OpenAI, Anthropic, or open-source, their behavior will be governed by unified semantic rules, ensuring operations align with corporate policies and objectives.\nStrict Auditing \u0026amp; Replayability for Compliance: Utilizing Semantic Ledger technology, we record all critical decisions and operations of AI agents. This allows enterprises not only to conduct rigorous post-hoc audits but also to \u0026ldquo;replay\u0026rdquo; entire event sequences when needed, meeting the compliance requirements of highly regulated industries such as finance and healthcare.\nSemantic Operations Standardization for Cross-Border SMEs: Offers a lightweight semantic framework for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), helping them standardize common processes in cross-border operations (e.g., orders, payments, legal matters).

My main contribution focuses on Agent\u0026rsquo;s Semantic Communication: how agents with DIDs can use Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to exchange and verify each other\u0026rsquo;s semantic commitments.\nLinux Foundation (LF): Within the open-source community, I promote reference implementations of the Semantic Execution Layer. The goal is to establish a neutral, widely adoptable open-source framework that allows AI products from different companies to interoperate on a common semantic foundation.\nEUDI Wallet (European Digital Identity Wallet): My research provides a theoretical model for the application of the EUDI Wallet in the age of AI. Especially in Identity \u0026amp; Authorization Models, it explores how the European Digital Identity Wallet can become a key infrastructure for individuals to authorize actions by their AI agents.\nOther Initiatives: Monitoring and participating in discussions concerning AI compliance frameworks, Algorithmic Accountability models, and providing feasibility analyses from a technical perspective based on semantic order.\n4.2 Institutional Observations How Semantic Order Provides Auditable AI: The \u0026ldquo;black box\u0026rdquo; nature of traditional AI is a major governance obstacle. The recording mechanism based on the Semantic Ledger makes AI\u0026rsquo;s decision-making chain transparent and immutable, providing a technical prerequisite for regulation and accountability.\nResponsibility Allocation in Multi-Agent Systems: When a task performed collaboratively by multiple AIs goes wrong, how is responsibility allocated? Semantic order provides a clear path for attribution by recording each agent\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;semantic commitment\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;actual behavior.\u0026rdquo;\nCompliance \u0026amp; The Semantic Ledger: Enterprise compliance policies (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) can be encoded into standardized \u0026ldquo;compliance semantic graphs.\u0026rdquo; The system can automatically verify that AI behavior consistently adheres to these graphs, and record verification results on the semantic ledger, thereby greatly simplifying compliance processes.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/work/standards/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"standards--governance-bringing-semantic-order-to-institutions\"\u003eStandards \u0026amp; Governance: Bringing Semantic Order to Institutions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe value of technology is ultimately reflected in how it integrates with existing institutions and drives their evolution.
