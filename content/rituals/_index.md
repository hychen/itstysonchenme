## What This Is

**The Human Common Oath** is a short public recitation designed for use by humans
when interacting with AI systems.

It is not a moral guideline for AI.  
It is not a safety policy.  
It is not a prompt.

It is a **linguistic safeguard for humans** —  
and more fundamentally, a safeguard for **human subjecthood**.

Language is the medium through which human agency,
responsibility, and self-recognition are exercised.
When language is increasingly mediated by AI systems,
human subjectivity itself becomes vulnerable to drift,
projection, and substitution.

This oath exists to mark a boundary:
not between correct and incorrect language,
but between **human presence** and automated response.

As language-based systems become increasingly persuasive,
this oath serves as a minimal reminder that
agency, authorship, and responsibility remain human —
even when cognition is assisted.

## Structure

This declaration exists in two parallel versions:

- 中文版本（original language context）
- English version (international public context)

Both versions are released into the **public domain**
and may be freely used, shared, translated,
or included in educational and public discussions.

## Intended Use

- Personal grounding before interacting with AI tools  
- Educational contexts discussing human–AI boundaries  
- Public literacy around AI-mediated language environments  

This text is intentionally simple.

Its function is not instruction, persuasion, or compliance.  
Its function is **remembering**:
that a human subject is present,
and remains responsible.
