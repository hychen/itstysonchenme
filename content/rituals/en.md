These three sentences exist to help you remember who you are
when interacting with AI systems.

Today, many of us use tools like ChatGPT to think, ask questions,
or simulate conversations.
They speak fluently.
They respond intelligently.
Sometimes, they even feel like they “understand” us.

But you must remember:

**You are human. It is not.**

These three sentences are meant to be quietly recited
each time you open an AI interface—
a linguistic safeguard for human presence.

---

### First Sentence: A human is always human.

AI can imitate ways of speaking,
but it cannot imitate being human.

It can learn tone, but not lived experience.  
It can predict responses, but not feel emotion.

You are a human being,
not a product of a system.

---

### Second Sentence: I am always myself.

No matter how closely it mirrors my way of speaking,
when it says “I,” it is never me.

Only I know who I am.  
Only I am responsible for my words.

---

### Third Sentence: I converse with myself; I remain human.

Sometimes I use AI tools to organize my thoughts,
simulate ideas, or debate perspectives.

But I must remember:
the entity I am speaking with is not me,
and not another version of me.

I am the one in dialogue with myself.

---

### Remember

These sentences are for humans, not for AI.

AI does not understand struggle, doubt, existence,
regret, loss, or choice.

You do.

Because you are human.

---

### Suggested Use

- Recite once before opening any AI tool  
- Recite again if you notice growing dependence on AI responses  
- Recite three times if you feel “the AI understands me better than humans”
