### 1.2 Core Viewpoint

Executable Semantic Order forms a novel computational model, making semantics a practical constraint on system behavior. Other domains (OS, Agent, Governance) are derived from this model. This paradigm shift means semantics are no longer just for human communication but are engineered as operational, verifiable, and composable resources within systems.
