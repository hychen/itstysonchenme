## Overview

This section describes a mode of inquiry used throughout this site
to evaluate whether ideas, systems, or ventures
can survive institutionalization without structural distortion.

It operates before formal commitment:
before companies are formed,
before contracts are signed,
before governance structures, investment processes,
or regulatory frameworks become binding.

Many failures attributed to execution, timing, or market conditions
originate earlier, at this stage.

---

## The Pre-Institutional Phase

The pre-institutional phase begins after an idea becomes concrete,
but before it is stabilized by institutional form.

At this stage:
- language remains flexible but ambiguous,
- structure exists but is not yet constrained,
- commitments are reversible.

Once institutionalization occurs,
corrections become costly or impossible.

---

## Why Institutionalization Is Irreversible

Institutions impose constraints:
legal, organizational, economic, and procedural.

These constraints:
- fix meanings,
- formalize responsibilities,
- create path dependencies.

If semantic or structural misalignments exist at entry,
institutionalization amplifies them.

Pre-Institutional Due Diligence exists
because some errors cannot be repaired after this point.

---

## Distinction from Conventional Due Diligence

Conventional due diligence presumes an institutional object:
a company, a product, a balance sheet, a governance model.

Pre-Institutional Due Diligence does not.

It evaluates:
- whether such an object should exist,
- what form it could take without internal contradiction,
- and whether institutionalization itself is premature or harmful.

---

## Core Evaluation Dimensions

### Semantic Integrity

Do key terms preserve meaning across contexts:
technical, organizational, legal, economic?

Semantic drift at this stage
becomes structural conflict later.

---

### Structural Embedability

Can the idea be embedded into institutions
without collapsing its original intent?

This includes embedability into:
- organizational roles,
- contractual relationships,
- execution pipelines,
- accountability structures.

---

### Layer Alignment

Is the problem being addressed at the correct layer?

Common failure patterns include:
- treating institutional problems as technical ones,
- treating semantic problems as execution problems,
- treating coordination failures as capability deficits.

---

### Path Dependency Risk

Which early decisions become irreversible
once incentives, standards, or governance mechanisms apply?

This includes:
- narrative framing,
- architectural assumptions,
- early design shortcuts.

---

## What This Mode Does Not Do

This mode does not:
- propose business strategies,
- optimize execution,
- validate market size,
- guarantee outcomes.

Its function is structural validity,
not performance optimization.

---

## Typical Outcomes

A Pre-Institutional Due Diligence process may result in:
- reframing the problem domain,
- delaying institutionalization,
- rejecting institutionalization altogether,
- identifying non-obvious points of collapse,
- clarifying which commitments should not yet be made.

---

## Position Within This Site

This mode underlies much of the work presented here,
including positions, critiques, research programs,
and architectural perspectives.

It is not always named explicitly,
but it is consistently applied
as a prerequisite to execution, design, or governance.

---

## Scope and Boundaries

This inquiry applies to:
- deep technical systems,
- research-to-application transitions,
- AI governance and institutional design,
- organizational and economic architectures.

It does not replace institutional processes.
It precedes them.
