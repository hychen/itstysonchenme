## Methodological Note

Much of the work presented here operates at a stage
prior to formal execution, optimization, or institutional commitment.

This site applies a mode of inquiry focused on evaluating
whether ideas, systems, or ventures
can survive institutionalization without semantic or structural distortion.

This pre-institutional evaluation
establishes the conditions under which institutional commitment
is justified.

Once such commitment is made,
questions of execution, accountability, and coordination
are addressed at the level of
[Executable Semantic Order](/overview/executable-semantic-order/).

For a description of the pre-institutional mode itself,
see [Pre-Institutional Due Diligence](/overview/pre-institutional-due-diligence/).
