Semantic ISA defines the semantic–execution boundary required for

semantic intent propagates through execution as opaque control flow,
making composite task behavior non-replayable
and responsibility assignment unstable.

The canonical definition is maintained here:

This page summarizes its role within the broader position on executable
semantic systems.
