I work on the construction of **executable semantic order**.

I publish and work under the name Hsin Yi (Tyson) Chen.

My research investigates the structural conditions under which semantics can function as an operational constraint within computational systems—shaping execution, coordination, and responsibility rather than remaining a descriptive layer.

This work is grounded in hands-on systems engineering experience across physical infrastructure and computational systems, including manufacturing processes, embedded and networked systems, data center operations, software infrastructure, applied AI systems, and civic technology.

My work does not follow a conventional academic trajectory; it emerged from sustained engagement with operational systems, where technical understanding was developed through self-directed study driven by practical necessity rather than academic abstraction.

My approach is shaped by direct exposure to environments where execution errors carry immediate material, operational, or physical consequences, leading to a focus on semantics as a governing structure rather than an interpretive layer.

This experience informs how I think about execution, risk, and responsibility in computational systems: decisions are made under constraint, feedback is not deferred, and errors cannot be abstracted away after the fact.

## Focus

The central concern of my work is structural rather than applicative.

I study how semantic commitments can be:
- made executable at runtime,
- externally auditable and replayable,
- and stable under composition across agents and systems.

This focus leads naturally to work on semantic instruction architectures, agent interfaces, identity and memory structures, and mechanisms for traceability and accountability.

## Roles

Alongside research, I engage in applied and institutional work where these structures are instantiated under real constraints.

This includes founding and leading [SlashLife AI](https://slashlife.ai), as well as participation in standards and governance activities related to AI systems, identity infrastructures, and accountable computation.

These roles are treated as **projections of the research**, not as independent pursuits.

## Orientation

This work sits at the intersection of computation, semantics, and system design.

It is motivated by the conviction that meaning must become operational if complex intelligent systems are to remain predictable, inspectable, and governable.
