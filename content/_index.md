title: "Researching Executable Semantic Order"
description: "A research program on making semantics executable, auditable, and composable across agents and systems."

I research how **semantic structures can be made executable**.

Rather than treating semantics as a descriptive or interpretive layer, my work investigates the structural conditions under which meaning operates as a concrete constraint on system behavior—governing what actions are possible, how they compose, and how responsibility is assigned.

This line of research defines **executable semantic order** as a computational model in which semantics participates directly in execution, verification, and coordination across agents and systems.
