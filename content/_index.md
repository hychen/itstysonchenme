## Researching Executable Semantic Order

My work focuses on designing the structural conditions that make semantics **operational, auditable, and composable** across agents and systems. This executable semantic order forms a new computational model where meaning becomes a practical constraint on system behavior.

### Representative Projections (Byproducts)

This central theme projects into several key areas of implementation and research:

*   **Semantic OS**: An operating system where semantic integrity is a core scheduling and execution primitive.
*   **Agent Identity & Execution**: A framework defining how autonomous agents can operate with verifiable identities and predictable behaviors based on semantic commitments.
*   **Multi-Agent Governance**: A model for establishing rules, responsibilities, and accountability in complex systems composed of multiple, independent AI agents.
