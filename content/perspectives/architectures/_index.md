This section presents the structural models and execution frameworks derived from the foundational axioms. Here, semantic principles are translated into operational mechanisms, forming the basis of AI execution environments, agent interfaces, and organizational coordination systems.

Architectures in this section define:

- How semantic intent becomes executable structure  
- How agents evaluate, transition, and complete tasks  
- How delegation and responsibility are represented in runtime conditions  
- How a semantic instruction layer mediates natural language and computation  

These documents describe not what a system does, but **how it must be constructed** for its behavior to remain verifiable and accountable.
