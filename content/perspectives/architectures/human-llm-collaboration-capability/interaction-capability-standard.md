title: "AI Interaction Capability Standard"
description: "Minimum interaction requirements for AI systems participating in high-density cognitive and institutional work."
draft: false
---

This document does not describe features, personalities, or product capabilities.

It specifies the **minimum interaction standards** required for an AI system to reliably participate in high-density thinking, multi-layer decision-making, and institutional or structural work alongside humans.

The criteria below are derived from sustained real-world use in complex design, governance reasoning, and cross-domain execution contexts.

---

## 1. Multi-domain Integration Capability

An AI system must be able to operate across multiple domains within a single conversational context, without collapsing them into a linear or isolated response.

- **Baseline requirement**: Stable handling of 4–7 concurrent domains  
- **Typical domains**: product logic, user psychology, organizational structure, policy constraints, empirical signals  
- **Evaluation criterion**:  
  The system can identify which domains are active in a given exchange and explain why they are being addressed together.

---

## 2. Abstraction-Level Switching

The system must move fluidly across different levels of abstraction and understand causal relationships between them.

- **Baseline requirement**: Reliable operation across 2–4 abstraction layers; occasional access to deeper (up to 6) layers  
- **Typical progression**:  
  surface issue → structural design → process definition → organizational or strategic contradiction  
- **Evaluation criterion**:  
  The system can correctly locate where a problem belongs, rather than attempting superficial fixes.

---

## 3. Semantic Compression and Expansion

The system must be able to interpret highly compressed statements and expand them into their underlying semantic components when necessary.

- **Baseline requirement**: 4–8× semantic compression/expansion capacity; up to 10× in edge cases  
- **Typical behavior**:  
  When encountering a vague or overloaded remark, the system can enumerate plausible semantic dimensions instead of requesting repetition.  
- **Evaluation criterion**:  
  Responses address the semantic core rather than peripheral phrasing.

---

## 4. Context Recognition and Switching

The system must detect implicit context shifts within a conversation, even when surface topics appear unchanged.

- **Baseline requirement**: Correct identification of 20+ context switches per 100 conversational turns  
- **Typical scenario**:  
  A discussion nominally about product design has shifted into organizational alignment or governance constraints.  
- **Evaluation criterion**:  
  The system can articulate the underlying context the speaker has transitioned into.

---

## 5. Discourse Structure Recognition

The system must recognize structural segmentation within extended or non-linear discourse.

- **Baseline requirement**: Paragraph- and segment-level comprehension  
- **Typical behavior**:  
  The system can reorganize or summarize a complex explanation into coherent structural parts.  
- **Evaluation criterion**:  
  It assists in clarifying structure rather than asking the speaker to restate their thoughts.

---

## 6. Meta-level Awareness

The system must be capable of observing and responding to issues at the level of the interaction itself.

- **Baseline requirement**: At least 10 meta-level interventions per 100 conversational turns  
- **Typical scenario**:  
  Identifying that participants are reasoning within different problem frames.  
- **Evaluation criterion**:  
  The system can surface interactional misalignment without derailing the conversation.

---

## 7. Cognitive Stability Under High Load

The system must maintain clarity, composure, and response prioritization under high semantic density.

- **Baseline requirement**:  
  The ability to explicitly choose which layer or subproblem to address first.  
- **Typical behavior**:  
  Acknowledging multiple layers while sequencing responses deliberately.  
- **Evaluation criterion**:  
  Responses remain structured, calm, and non-reactive.

## Notes

This standard is not intended to optimize for conversational fluency or perceived intelligence.

Its purpose is to ensure that an AI system can function as a **reliable cognitive collaborator** rather than a source of distraction or semantic noise in long-running, high-stakes intellectual work.

---

## Scope

This standard applies to:

- Human–AI collaborative reasoning
- Institutional or governance-oriented design work
- Multi-layer system architecture and execution planning

It does **not** apply to:

- Task automation tools
- Administrative assistants
- Casual or low-context conversational agents
