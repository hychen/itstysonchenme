title: "Human–LLM Collaboration Capabilities"
description: "From Tool Use to Semantic Co-construction"
---

Human–LLM collaboration spans multiple levels of capability.

These levels do not describe intelligence,
nor do they imply personhood or autonomy.
They describe how language is used,
how structure is introduced,
and how responsibility is managed
in increasingly complex forms of collaboration.

---

## Capability progression

### Tool-assisted use

Language models are used as tools:
retrieval, drafting, summarization.

Interaction is transactional.
Execution authority remains fully external.

---

### Extraction and synthesis

The user actively guides the model
to surface relevant information,
identify salient segments,
and reduce noise.

Value lies in question formulation
and selective interpretation.

---

### Structured output

Language is used to produce
lists, outlines, presentations,
or scripts.

Structure is imposed explicitly,
and correctness is evaluated
at the output level.

---

### Modular semantic design

Tasks are decomposed into semantic units
with defined inputs, outputs, and constraints.

Interaction shifts from prompts
to interface-like specifications.

---

### Narrative construction

Language is used to construct
coherent long-form reasoning,
institutional drafts,
or policy-like structures.

Correctness depends on
consistency, scope, and internal alignment.

---

### Semantic co-construction

At advanced levels,
humans and language models
co-design semantic structures:
tone systems, role boundaries,
and reusable linguistic modules.

Here, collaboration is no longer reactive.
It is architected.

---

## Boundary note

This progression describes capability alignment, not agency transfer.

Questions of governance, authorization, and responsibility
are addressed elsewhere through explicit semantic constraints.
