Executable language systems must operate across multiple levels of semantic depth.

Some interactions require rapid response.
Others require structured reasoning, delegation, or institutional consistency.
Treating all language operations as belonging to a single execution mode
creates instability, misalignment, and uncontrolled escalation.

This document outlines how semantic execution systems
manage depth, control, and stability
without relying on implicit model behavior.

---

## Semantic depth as an operational concern

Semantic depth refers to how much structural commitment
an execution requires.

Shallow operations resolve localized intent
with minimal structural impact.
Deeper operations introduce dependencies,
constraints, and longer-lived effects.

Failure to distinguish these depths
leads to systems that either overreact
or overcommit.

Semantic depth is therefore treated
as an operational parameter,
not a philosophical category.

## Layered execution, not layered intelligence

The layers described here do not represent intelligence levels
or cognitive hierarchies.

They describe execution modes:
how language is interpreted,
how much structure is introduced,
and what degree of control is required.

Each mode imposes different requirements on:

- Validation
- Completion criteria
- Responsibility assignment
- Stability guarantees

---

## Core execution layers

At a high level, semantic execution systems operate across
a small number of distinct layers:

### Reactive execution

Focused on immediacy and bounded scope.

Execution resolves localized intent
with minimal persistence
and limited side effects.

Stability is maintained through strict scope limits.

---

### Task-oriented execution

Language is used to coordinate actions,
decompose objectives,
and track progress.

Execution introduces structure,
but remains constrained to explicit tasks.

Completion conditions are well-defined
and responsibility remains localized.

---

### Structural execution

Language is used to construct
or modify semantic structures:
plans, workflows, or institutional artifacts.

Execution at this layer requires:

- Explicit intermediate representations
- Formal completion semantics
- Clear responsibility boundaries

Stability becomes a primary concern.

---

### Governance-aware execution

Language operates across
organizational or institutional boundaries.

Execution must remain coherent
under delegation, interruption,
and audit.

This layer demands explicit control mechanisms
rather than heuristic inference.

---

## Stability and self-monitoring

As semantic depth increases,
execution systems must monitor
their own behavior.

This includes detecting:

- Scope drift
- Unresolved commitments
- Structural inconsistency
- Premature termination

Such monitoring is not a meta-feature.
It is part of the execution surface
required to prevent collapse
under complex workloads.

---

## Controlled transitions between layers

Critical failures occur
when systems transition between semantic depths
without explicit acknowledgment.

Safe systems treat transitions
as controlled operations:

- Escalation requires justification
- De-escalation requires resolution
- Suspension preserves responsibility state

Semantic depth is not climbed accidentally.

---

## Why this matters

Without explicit management of semantic depth:

- Systems overfit to conversational success
- Execution correctness becomes ambiguous
- Responsibility assignment breaks down
- Institutional adoption becomes infeasible

Layered semantic operation
is therefore not an optimization.
It is a prerequisite for executable language systems
that operate beyond isolated interactions.

---

## Relation to foundational constraints

The execution layers described here
operate under the constraints established in the foundations layer:

- Semantics precede models
- Completion defines correctness
- Responsibility binds execution

These layers do not override those constraints.
They exist to make them operable.

---

## Reading note

This document describes *how*
semantic execution systems manage depth and stability.

It does not enumerate internal capability maps
or cognitive models.

Those details remain implementation-specific
and intentionally out of scope.
