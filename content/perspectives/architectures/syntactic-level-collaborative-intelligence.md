This document distinguishes two fundamentally different but interrelated systems
in contemporary human–LLM interaction.

The first concerns the internal execution capacity of language models.
The second concerns the cognitive and operational capacity of human users
to collaborate with such systems.

The distinction is critical.
Most discussions conflate model capability with usage capability.
This framework treats them as separate but coupled domains.

---

## Two distinct capability systems

### A. Language models as execution systems

Language models can be understood as language execution agents:
systems capable of interpreting input,
generating structured output,
and operating across multiple semantic regimes.

Their internal capability range may include:
syntactic manipulation,
tone modulation,
narrative construction,
institutional drafting,
and higher-order semantic coordination.

This document does not enumerate or classify internal model layers.
Those remain implementation-dependent.

---

### B. Human capability in LLM collaboration

More consequential is the second system:
the human capacity to *operate* language models effectively.

Using an LLM is not a binary condition.
It is a graded capability space.

The ability to write prompts
does not imply the ability to co-construct narratives,
semantic systems,
or institutional language structures.

The following levels describe
progressively deeper forms of human–LLM collaboration.

---

## Human–LLM collaboration capability levels

### Level 1 — Tool use

The model is treated as a conversational or retrieval tool.

Interaction is reactive.
Semantic responsibility remains entirely with the user.

This level dominates casual and exploratory use.

---

### Level 2 — Answer extraction

The user learns to ask better questions
and selectively extract useful information
from generated responses.

Prompt techniques emerge,
but interaction remains output-oriented.

---

### Level 3 — Structured output

Language is used to produce
lists, sections, scripts,
or code scaffolding.

The model supports task execution,
but structure is imposed externally.

---

### Level 4 — Modular semantic thinking

Tasks are decomposed into semantic units
with defined inputs, outputs, and constraints.

Interaction resembles interface specification
rather than conversation.

Most contemporary “AI engineering” practices
stabilize at this level.

---

### Level 5 — Narrative construction

The user can extend a viewpoint
into coherent long-form reasoning,
institutional drafts,
or policy-like language.

Correctness depends on
internal consistency,
scope control,
and semantic alignment.

---

### Level 6 — Syntactic co-construction

At this level,
humans and language models
jointly construct language systems themselves.

This includes:
- tone modules
- role definitions
- reusable narrative structures
- institutional or procedural grammars

The model is no longer a tool.
It becomes a collaborator
within explicitly designed semantic constraints.

This level marks a transition:
from language use
to language system participation.

---

### Level 7 — Meta-semantic governance

The user can define
how semantic modules are authorized,
combined,
or terminated.

Responsibility,
scope,
and delegation
are treated as first-class constructs.

This level is unstable without strong constraints
and is not typically sustained in continuous operation.

---

### Level 8 — Cognitive architecture design

Language is treated as an ecosystem.

The user designs
human–AI collaboration patterns,
role protocols,
and long-lived semantic environments.

This level aligns with emerging work
in semantic institutional design.

---

### Levels 9+

At higher levels,
language is treated as an evolving technical substrate
for knowledge production,
coordination,
and governance.

These levels remain under active exploration
and are not formally named.

---

## On Level 6 as a stability threshold

Within this framework,
Level 6 represents a critical threshold.

It is the point at which
language models become usable
for institutional and systemic work,
not merely for assistance.

Below this level,
models augment productivity.
At and above it,
they participate in the construction
of the language systems
that govern action.

This distinction explains why
many advanced applications
remain inaccessible
despite apparent model capability.

The limitation lies not in the model,
but in the collaborative capacity.

---

## Closing note

This framework does not prescribe progression.
Nor does it evaluate individuals.

It provides a vocabulary
for discussing capability,
risk,
and responsibility
in human–LLM collaboration.

Understanding where interaction operates
is a prerequisite
for designing systems
that are stable,
governable,
and institutionally viable.
