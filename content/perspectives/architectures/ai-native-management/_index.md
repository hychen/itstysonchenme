This section explores how semantic execution fundamentally redefines organizational design and management in the age of AI. It moves beyond traditional hierarchical models to envision enterprises as dynamic networks of autonomous agents, governed by clear intents, capabilities, and verifiable delegations.

From the use cases in this section, the reader can draw two key insights:

1.  **The enterprise itself becomes a dynamic, programmable system.** The evolution from a simple contract manufacturer (OEM) to a global brand (OBM) is not a series of disruptive reorganizations, but a fluid evolution of the agent network's intents and delegations. The architecture adapts as the business strategy evolves.

2.  **Complex capabilities are composed from trusted, specialized agents.** High-level business functions, like managing a global supply chain, are broken down into verifiable, delegable tasks like supplier verification and payment execution. This creates a resilient and auditable system where trust is established at every step.

Ultimately, AI-native management is about defining the enterprise through programmable, verifiable relationships rather than static human roles.
