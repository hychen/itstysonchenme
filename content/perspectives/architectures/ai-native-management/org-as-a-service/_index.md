## A Century-Old Assumption Set

For more than a hundred years, management theory has rested on three implicit assumptions:

1. Organizations are **built internally**  
   People are hired, processes are designed, departments are formed.

2. Organizations are **structurally stable**  
   Meaningful reconfiguration requires long planning cycles, often spanning years.

3. Organizational boundaries are **clearly defined**  
   A firm is separated into “inside” and “outside,” with outsourcing treated as a secondary extension.

These assumptions shaped the entire canon of modern management—from Taylorism and bureaucracy to contemporary MBA curricula.  
They were reasonable in an era where coordination costs were high and execution depended on physical proximity.

That era is ending.

## The Emergence of Org-as-a-Service (OaaS)

A new organizational primitive is quietly forming: **Org-as-a-Service (OaaS)**.

Just as cloud computing separated *infrastructure ownership* from *infrastructure usage*,  
OaaS separates *organizational construction* from *organizational execution*.

An OaaS module is not software in the conventional sense.  
It is a **pre-assembled unit of execution** that already contains:

- Role definitions  
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs)  
- Accountability and escalation chains  
- Compliance logic  
- Performance interfaces  

Instead of hiring staff, designing workflows, or engaging consultants, a firm subscribes to a functioning organizational unit.

The abstraction shift is precise:

- **SaaS** sells functions  
- **IaaS** sells infrastructure  
- **OaaS** sells organizations

## What Changes at the Core of Management

### Organizations Become Purchasable

Functions traditionally considered “internal”—HR, finance, compliance, procurement—can be delivered as modular, subscription-based organizations.

Management no longer starts with *building capacity* but with *selecting organizational primitives*.

---

### Organizational Reconfiguration Becomes Instant

Restructuring no longer implies a 12–24 month transformation program.

An organizational unit can be replaced, scaled, or reconfigured by switching modules—  
not by rewriting job descriptions, retraining staff, or renegotiating authority structures.

Time-to-execution collapses.

---

### Organizational Boundaries Become Fluid

The firm is no longer defined by employment contracts.

Instead, it consists of:

- A **core decision and identity layer**
- A dynamic set of **subscribed organizational modules**

“Inside vs outside” dissolves into a spectrum of integration depth.

---

## A Shift in the Source of Competitive Advantage

Under OaaS, competitive advantage no longer comes primarily from:

- Proprietary processes  
- Unique organizational culture  
- Long-developed internal capabilities  

Instead, it shifts toward:

- **Organizational purchasing power**  
- The ability to identify, integrate, and orchestrate superior organizational modules faster than competitors  

Execution quality becomes a function of *organizational composition*, not internal design brilliance.

---

## What Happens to Management Functions

### Human Resources

HR transitions from headcount management to **organizational curation**:

- Selecting compatible modules  
- Managing interfaces between human teams and subscribed organizations  
- Governing accountability across modular boundaries  

---

### Strategy

Strategy becomes less about internal alignment and more about:

- Deciding **what must remain core**
- Deciding **what can be subscribed**
- Managing dependency, lock-in, and organizational optionality  

---

### Organizational Theory

The foundational verb of management changes:

- From **create**
- To **subscribe**

This is not a tooling change.  
It is a shift in the unit of analysis.

## The New Question Management Cannot Avoid

For the first time in a century, management theory faces a structurally new condition.

When organizations themselves become subscribable:

**What remains the true role of management?**

Coordination?  
Selection?  
Governance?  
Identity maintenance?  

The answer is no longer obvious—and that is precisely why management theory must be rewritten.
