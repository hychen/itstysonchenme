## Abstract

Play-to-Earn (P2E) and Create-to-Earn have been widely promoted as the future of the game industry, particularly within crypto-native and so-called *Autonomous World* narratives. These models promise economic participation, ownership, and creator empowerment. This paper argues that such promises rest on a structural misunderstanding of what makes games function as games. Once a game economy is required to interoperate with real-world productivity and labor markets, it ceases to be a game and becomes an industrial system. The result is not empowerment, but the collapse of play.

## 1. The Ambiguity of “Autonomous World”

The term *Autonomous World* originated from fully on-chain games, but it has since expanded into a vague umbrella concept. Its appeal lies precisely in this ambiguity. When pressed for a precise definition, proponents often retreat into abstraction: autonomy of code, autonomy of agents, autonomy of economies.

Yet autonomy without boundary conditions is meaningless. A system is not autonomous simply because it is decentralized or self-executing. The critical question is whether the system can remain *structurally closed*—that is, insulated from external production forces—while sustaining internal meaning and motivation.

Most so-called Autonomous Worlds fail this test.

## 2. Roblox Is Not a Counterexample

[Roblox](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0) is frequently cited as evidence that Create-to-Earn works. This comparison is misleading.

Structurally, Roblox functions as:
- a game engine comparable to Unity,
- a distribution and discovery layer comparable to Steam,
- a tightly controlled internal economy with platform-governed exchange rates.

Roblox succeeds not because it externalizes value, but because it **contains** it. Its currency is redeemable, but not free-floating. Its labor market is curated, throttled, and asymmetrically governed. Most participants do not meaningfully earn; they learn, experiment, and occasionally graduate into a creator role.

Roblox does not collapse because it does not pretend to be an open labor economy.

## 3. The Inevitable Floor of Play-to-Earn

Play-to-Earn collapses toward a single outcome: the global minimum wage.

Once earning becomes a primary motivation, optimization replaces play. Bots, automation, and organized farming emerge naturally—not as exploits, but as rational responses. The game economy is then forced to compete with real-world labor markets, where productivity, scale, and automation dominate.

At this point:
- fairness degrades,
- intrinsic motivation disappears,
- and game design regresses into repetitive extraction loops.

The system does not fail accidentally. It fails deterministically.

## 4. Why Dual-Currency and Consumable Economies Only Delay Collapse

Some games attempt to mitigate inflation through sophisticated economic design. [Path of Exile](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1) famously abandoned single-currency systems in favor of consumable currencies that double as crafting resources.

This design achieves two things:
- it slows inflation,
- it turns gold farmers into liquidity providers rather than pure adversaries.

However, this is not a solution—only a delay. Even in such systems, economic reset remains necessary. New leagues function as controlled world reboots. The underlying reason is simple: real-world productivity always outpaces closed virtual economies.

No in-game mechanism can permanently absorb external labor pressure.

## 5. Crypto-Native Games and the Exception That Proves the Rule

[Dark Forest](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=2) is often cited as a successful crypto-native game. It is an exception precisely because automation and bots do **not** undermine its core gameplay. Strategic opacity, information asymmetry, and cognitive load are integral to the experience.

But this reveals a crucial truth:  
Dark Forest is compelling *despite* economicization, not because of it.

Moreover, such games appeal primarily to:
- speculators who do not meaningfully play, and
- intellectual hobbyists who enjoy system construction rather than immersion.

They are not representative of mainstream games, nor are they evidence that earning-based play scales.

## 6. The Destruction of the Fictional World

Games rely on a fragile contract: the player agrees to suspend reality in exchange for meaning within a fictional system.

Create-to-Earn and NFT-based mechanics fracture this contract. Once players become conscious of themselves as labor units within a hyper-industrialized pipeline, immersion collapses. The game world is no longer a world—it is a dashboard.

What is lost is not balance, but *fictional coherence*.

## 7. Conclusion: Earning Is Not the Future of Play

Play-to-Earn and Create-to-Earn do not resolve the structural problems of the game industry. They externalize them. By linking games to real-world productivity, they ensure that:
- play is subordinated to labor,
- creativity is subordinated to optimization,
- and worlds are subordinated to markets.

A system that must compete with reality will always lose its fiction.

The future of games will not be built on earning.  
It will be built on boundaries.
