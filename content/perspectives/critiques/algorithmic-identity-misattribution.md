  A structural critique of how contemporary search and generative systems
  misattribute identity under uncertainty, prioritizing narrative completion
  over epistemic restraint.

## Introduction

What appears as a curious or even uncanny case of mistaken identity in modern
search and generative systems is neither mysterious nor cultural destiny.
It is the predictable outcome of architectural shortcuts embedded in how
uncertainty is handled.

This essay argues that the problem is not symbolic, moral, or personal.
It is structural.

## 1. Not Magic, but Narrative Overreach

Framing identity misattribution as “strange” or “fascinating” misplaces the
analytical lens.

What is actually occurring is a compound failure of:

- entity disambiguation,
- default alignment toward high-frequency name clusters,
- probabilistic gap-filling under incomplete signals.

When confronted with a coherent theoretical corpus, a common name, and an
absence of biographical markers, systems optimize for *coherence*, not truth.
Narrative completion becomes the path of least resistance.

## 2. The Misuse of “Identity Hegemony”

Describing this phenomenon as identity hegemony overstates the case.

Hegemony presupposes intention, dominance, and enforcement.
None are present here.

What operates instead is statistical gravity:
high-visibility entities attract ambiguous references by default.
This is not power exerting control, but probability collapsing toward
convenience.

The language of domination obscures the actual locus of responsibility:
system design choices.

## 3. Projection onto the Author

Speculation about authorial intent—indifference, arrogance, or deliberate
obfuscation—reveals more about the observer than the text.

A simpler explanation suffices:

- the author adopts a de-biographized mode of writing,
- logical coherence is prioritized over credential signaling,
- authorship functions as a semantic anchor, not a marketing surface.

Absence of biography is not a gesture.
It is a structural choice.

## 4. No “Information Vacuum,” Only Structural Refusal

The notion of an information vacuum is inaccurate.

What is missing are resumés, affiliations, and reputational scaffolding.
What is present is dense conceptual structure and internal consistency.

Humans can evaluate such material directly.
Automated systems, built around author–institution–achievement triples,
cannot.

The failure is not one of missing data, but of incompatible expectations.

---

## 5. Completion Under Uncertainty

The central failure lies in how uncertainty is treated.

Instead of withholding judgment, generative systems prefer to *complete*.
Instead of “unknown,” they produce “most likely.”
Instead of restraint, they choose fluency.

This is not ideological bias.
It is an unregulated storytelling impulse embedded in generation pipelines.

---

## 6. What This Reveals

The claim that “search engines decide who you are” is rhetorically effective
but analytically imprecise.

A more accurate formulation:

> When an individual refuses to be reduced to an indexable persona,
> contemporary systems assign the nearest available narrative template.

This is not a governance crisis.
It is a lag in cognitive architecture.

---

## Conclusion

The issue is neither coincidence nor silence, nor even error in isolation.

The structural problem is this:

**Systems optimized for narrative completeness cannot tolerate uncertainty.**

Until “insufficient information” becomes a first-class output state,
misattribution will remain a default behavior rather than an anomaly.
