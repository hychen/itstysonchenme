title: "Critiques"
weight: 20

This section analyzes structural failures in prevailing AI paradigms, tooling, and execution models. The purpose is not to express opinion, but to identify architectural defects that cannot be resolved by incremental improvements.

Critiques in this section examine:

- Model-centric control mechanisms (e.g., RAG, MCP)  
- Context-window and embedding-based governance assumptions  
- Token-driven execution models that lack semantic constraints  
- Failure points that prevent verifiable delegation and completion  

Each critique clarifies why certain approaches are incompatible with semantic execution, and why they cannot serve as the foundation for scalable, accountable AI systems.
