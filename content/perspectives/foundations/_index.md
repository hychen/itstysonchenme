This section defines the non-negotiable axioms and structural premises that underlie all subsequent work on semantic execution, agent systems, and AI governance.

Foundations establish the minimum conditions for any system to be considered governable, auditable, and capable of supporting machine-level delegation. These documents do not describe applications or architectures; they specify the semantic requirements that make such architectures possible.

Topics in this section include:

- Axioms governing semantic primacy over models  
- Completion as the unit of correctness  
- Responsibility as an assignable, transferable, and terminable construct  
- The boundaries of semantic execution as a computational paradigm  

All later articles, standards, and system designs inherit their semantic constraints from this section.
