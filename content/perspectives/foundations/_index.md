title: "Foundations"
weight: 1
---

This section defines the axioms and structural premises
that are treated as non-negotiable throughout this work.

Foundations do not propose architectures or applications.
They specify the minimal semantic conditions under which
any system claiming to support executable language,
agent-based delegation, or institutional AI
can be considered coherent, governable, and auditable.

The purpose of this section is to establish
what must already be true
before questions of models, optimization, or deployment are meaningful.

## Scope

Topics addressed here include:

- Axioms asserting semantic primacy over model behavior  
- Completion defined as a condition of correctness, not output  
- Responsibility modeled as a grantable, transferable, and terminable construct  
- The boundaries of semantic execution as a computational paradigm  

These foundations define constraints, not preferences.

All subsequent positions, standards, and system designs
inherit their semantic limits from this section.
They are evaluated against it, not alongside it.
