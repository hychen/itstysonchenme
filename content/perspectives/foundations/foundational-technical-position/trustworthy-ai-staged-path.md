## Trustworthy AI as an Engineering Path

What is often described today as *“Trustworthy AI”* is not a single technology, nor a regulatory slogan.  
It is an engineering trajectory that unfolds in stages.

What we currently see in most products represents only the first third of that path.

---

## Stage I — SaaS 2.0: Service-as-Agent-Service

The first stage corresponds to what can be called **SaaS 2.0**:  
software services wrapped as agents.

At this stage, agents automate tasks, coordinate workflows, and replace portions of human operations.  
They improve efficiency, but they do **not** yet resolve responsibility.

This layer maps closely to early policy discussions of trustworthy AI:  
useful, assistive, but still dependent on external human accountability.

It is a necessary foundation — and only that.

---

## Stage II — SaaS 3.0: Service-as-Agent-Contract-Service

The second stage introduces a structural shift.

Here, services are no longer just agents.  
They become **contract-bearing agents**.

This layer handles:

- Responsibility attribution  
- Risk mapping  
- Automated fulfillment and breach conditions  

Only at this stage does *trust* become an internal property of the system, rather than an external promise.

Without agent-level contract logic, liability remains ambiguous, and AI systems remain uninsurable.

This completes the second third of the trustworthy AI path.

---

## Stage III — Regulation as a Closing Layer

Only **after** the first two stages are in place does regulation become meaningful.

Regulation cannot substitute for missing responsibility logic.  
It can only operate once systems are:

- Contract-aware  
- Risk-expressive  
- Auditable by design  

At that point, regulation closes the loop rather than attempting to enforce trust from the outside.

This is the final third of the path.

## Taiwan’s Structural Position

This staged path aligns unusually well with Taiwan’s industrial strengths.

Taiwan does not need to become a model-centric AI power.  
Its advantage lies elsewhere:

- OEM / ODM capability  
- Process standardization  
- System integration under constraint  

Agent systems built on contractual responsibility extend naturally from these strengths.

This is a structural opportunity, not a catch-up race.

---

## SaaS Is Fragmenting, Agents Are Coming Online

As systems move toward risk-oriented deployment:

- Model size becomes less decisive  
- Data volume becomes less central  
- Traditional SaaS scale effects begin to fragment  

Agent architectures reorganize services around responsibility, not features.

This is not a question of technical feasibility, but of recognition.

---

## From Manufacturing Economy to Entrepreneurial Economy

When SaaS can be packaged as agents, the limiting factor is no longer headcount.

The bottleneck becomes intent.

With agent-native tooling, individuals can deploy AI workers directly.  
Entrepreneurship becomes the default interface to production.

This shift offers an alternative response to demographic decline.

---

## What Industry Actually Asks

In practice, legacy industries ask only three questions when adopting AI:

1. Will this cause incidents?
2. Who is responsible?
3. Can it be insured?

Technology alone does not answer these.

What is being sold is not intelligence —  
but **risk transfer capability**.

---

## Closing Note

Trustworthy AI is not achieved by declaring trust.

It emerges when agents can act, commit, fail, and be held accountable —  
within systems designed for that reality.
