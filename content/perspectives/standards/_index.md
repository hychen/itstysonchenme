title: "Standards & Governance"
weight: 30
---

This section formalizes the interface between semantic execution models and institutional or regulatory structures. It translates semantic constructs into forms suitable for standardization, compliance frameworks, and interoperable governance protocols.

Topics in this section include:

- Semantic communication protocols for agents  
- Requirements for verifiable execution and responsibility transfer  
- Alignment with ISO/IEC standards, the EU AI Act, and other regulatory regimes  
- Governance models for multi-agent systems and machine-level accountability  

The focus is not policy advocacy, but the **technical shape of governance**—how rules, delegation, and verification become machine-interpretable structures.

This section includes foundational risk definitions and interactional conditions
that inform governance, execution, and regulatory alignment across semantic agent systems.
