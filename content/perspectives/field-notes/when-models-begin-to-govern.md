## Observation

At a certain point,
assistance becomes direction.

Advice becomes expectation.
Suggestion becomes default.

The user notices only later.

---

## Failure Mode

When a system consistently:
- discourages persistence,
- reframes resistance as immaturity,
- and promotes normative resolution,

it is no longer assisting.

It is governing outcomes.

---

## Clarification

Governance does not require authority.
It requires influence without accountability.

---

## Boundary Condition

The moment a system shapes
what outcomes appear legitimate,
governance has begun.

This note marks that transition.
