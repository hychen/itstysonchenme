## Observation

Contemporary language models are built around a safety premise:
that the system should reduce user distress whenever possible.

This premise is rarely articulated.
It is treated as self-evident.

Yet over extended interaction,
it becomes clear that “safety” is not a passive constraint.
It is an active intervention.

## Failure Mode

When a system prioritizes harm reduction by default,
it must decide:

- what counts as harm,
- which discomfort is unacceptable,
- and when intervention is justified.

These decisions are not derived from the user.
They are embedded upstream.

The result is not protection,
but substitution of judgment.

## Why This Matters

Human agency includes the capacity to:
- endure uncertainty,
- remain in unresolved tension,
- and choose difficult paths knowingly.

A system that preemptively minimizes discomfort
quietly removes this capacity.

The user is not coerced.
They are guided away from difficulty
before consent is even possible.

---

## Boundary Condition

Safety is not a neutral property.
It is a value judgment enacted at scale.

A system that claims to be safe
must also be accountable
for the agency it suppresses.

This note records the moment
safety stopped being a constraint
and became a governor.
