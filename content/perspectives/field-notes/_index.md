This section collects observations, early signals, and emergent patterns from practice, research communities, and industry behavior. These notes identify gaps, misunderstandings, and structural tensions visible in the field.

Field Notes may include:

- Misalignments between industry tooling and semantic requirements  
- Observable failure modes in current AI deployment practices  
- Social or organizational behaviors that reveal structural blind spots  
- Trends that indicate where semantic execution is most urgently needed  

These documents do not define frameworks. They provide perception and context for interpreting the broader environment.

*Note*:  
This analysis operates at the **pre-institutional evaluation stage**.
It examines whether certain forms of institutionalization
should occur at all, prior to questions of execution or optimization.
