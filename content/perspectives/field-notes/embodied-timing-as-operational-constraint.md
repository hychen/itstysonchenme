My engagement with dance did not precede my work in computer science.
It came after years of thinking in terms of formal systems, execution models, and computational control.

This ordering matters.

Social dance — particularly partner dance with explicit leading and following — exposed the limits of output-driven, predictive coordination in a way that abstract agent models could not.

In social dance, stable coordination does not emerge from faster inference or earlier decision-making.
It emerges from maintaining a shared temporal envelope — a co-semantic session — where neither party collapses the interaction into unilateral control.

Leading is not command.
Following is not submission.

Both are continuous acts of permission, timing, and mutual adjustment.

What breaks the dance is not incorrect movement, but premature certainty.

When perception is immediately consumed by prediction:
- sensation is reduced to output material,
- experience collapses into control,
- and the relational field disappears.

This distinction matters for agent design.

A system that always resolves perception into action too early may remain technically correct,
yet fail to sustain relational stability.

Social dance is not a fast-thinking domain.
It is a domain where rhythm and relationship are co-constitutive.

If one agent consistently arrives half a beat early:
- synchronization degrades,
- the partner feels overridden,
- and the shared structure dissolves — even if the steps are formally correct.

This exposes a boundary between computable alignment and experiential coherence.

Some forms of coordination are inductive.
Others are coinductive — sustained not by inference, but by allowing the interaction to remain unresolved long enough to stabilize itself.

This insight extends beyond human interaction.

It informs how human agents and non-human agents should be differentiated:
- not only by capability,
- but by how subjectivity is preserved or overridden during coordination.

Logic permits inference.
Emotion permits only allowance.

The space of allowance is inherently fuzzy, temporal, and relational.
Yet without it, no stable co-semantic system — human or machine — can persist.
