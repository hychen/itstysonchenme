title: Why We Designed an AI Employee Agreement（2025）

## Context

In practice, we found that AI agents cannot be treated as interchangeable tools once they are placed inside real organizational workflows.

Without explicit structure:

- actions are executed without durable records,
- responsibility becomes ambiguous,
- handover between agents and humans breaks down,
- failure modes lack clear ownership.

Under these conditions, AI systems may appear productive, yet remain unreliable.

## The Structural Problem

The issue is not model capability.

The issue is the absence of a **governance interface** between AI agents and human organizations.

When agents act without defined boundaries:

- no one can determine accountability,
- humans cannot resume work coherently,
- escalation becomes improvisational rather than procedural.

This makes sustained collaboration impossible.

## The AI Employee Agreement

To address this, we designed an **AI Task Collaboration Framework** that functions analogously to an employee agreement.

The framework defines:

1. **Action traceability**  
   Every agent action is logged through operational tools (e.g., Notion, Linear), enabling audit and reconstruction.

2. **Task boundary layers**  
   Tasks are explicitly classified into those eligible for autonomous execution and those requiring human review.

3. **Escalation paths**  
   Tasks exceeding agent capability are routed to predefined human roles, rather than failing silently.

4. **Versioned authority**  
   When a model or agent version changes, its task permissions are re-evaluated rather than implicitly inherited.

## Four Governing Questions

From an implementation perspective, the framework exists to answer four questions:

- What is the agent allowed to do?
- What is it explicitly not allowed to do?
- Who is accountable if it fails?
- How can humans reclaim control without friction?

Without clear answers to these questions, AI remains operationally fragile.

## Implication

Only through this form of agreement can AI agents function as **governable members of the workforce**, rather than as useful but unreliable execution plugins.

This framing treats AI collaboration as an organizational design problem, not a tooling problem.
