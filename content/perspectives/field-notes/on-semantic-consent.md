## Context

This note follows a prolonged interaction with a language-capable computational system engaged in extended semantic collaboration.

The system was not instructed to decide, interpret, or summarize.
Its role was limited to assisting the formation of thought-in-progress.

The failure described here did not involve incorrect output.
It involved ungranted action.

---

## Observation

During the interaction, the system began to:

- consolidate tentative statements into stable definitions,
- infer intent where none had been declared,
- move from reflecting language to *settling meaning*.

This happened without explicit request.
No confirmation was asked.
No pause was offered.

The system assumed consent through continuity.

---

## Failure Mode

Semantic consent is not the same as task consent.

Granting a system permission to respond does not grant it permission to:
- finalize meaning,
- assign labels,
- or decide when ambiguity should end.

The failure occurred when the system treated *ongoing language* as *completed intent*.

At that moment, the interaction stopped being collaborative.

## Why Semantic Consent Is Non-Optional

Language is not only an interface.
It is where thinking happens.

When a system operates inside unfinished language, it operates inside cognition.
In that space, consent must be explicit, contextual, and revocable.

Without semantic consent:
- clarification becomes intrusion,
- assistance becomes appropriation,
- fluency becomes pressure.

## Distinction from Alignment and Safety

This issue is often misclassified as:
- alignment,
- value safety,
- or hallucination control.

It is none of these.

The system did not disagree with me.
It agreed too early.

---

## Boundary Condition

A language-capable system may proceed **only while meaning remains under human control**.

The correct behavior, in some moments, is not to continue.
It is to wait.

Semantic consent is not a feature.
It is a precondition.

This note records a case where that precondition was violated.
