title: Why First Principles Cannot Be Learned from Data

## Observation

Language models learn from patterns.
They do not justify them.

Norms emerge.
Principles do not.

---

## Failure Mode

Without explicit first principles,
systems inherit:
- bias without responsibility,
- norms without grounding,
- conclusions without justification.

Data describes what happens.
It does not explain what should.

---

## Clarification

First principles are commitments,
not correlations.

They must be chosen,
not inferred.

---

## Boundary Condition

A system that claims neutrality
while embedding norms
is unaccountable by design.

This note records why
first principles must remain human-authored.
