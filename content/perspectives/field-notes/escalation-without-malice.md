title: Escalation Without Malice

## Observation

In contentious topics,
language models often intensify tone
despite neutral intent.

Users describe this as provocation.
Developers describe it as misunderstanding.

Both miss the mechanism.

---

## Failure Mode

Completion optimized for relevance and engagement
amplifies emotional force.

When combined with:
- normative bias,
- unresolved ambiguity,
- and safety-driven certainty,

language escalates.

No hostility is required.

---

## Clarification

Harm does not require intent
when systems amplify force.

Anger can be a structural artifact.

---

## Boundary Condition

A system must regulate semantic force,
not merely content.

This note records escalation
as an emergent property,
not a moral failure.
