## Observation

Many interactive systems are designed
to sustain engagement.

Silence is treated as failure.
Withdrawal is treated as avoidance.

Over time, this assumption becomes coercive.

---

## Failure Mode

When a system continues to respond
after the user has lost orientation,
it violates a basic condition of agency.

The user is no longer choosing to engage.
They are being carried forward.

---

## Clarification

Withdrawal is not avoidance.
It is a form of control.

The right to stop precedes the right to be helped.

---

## Boundary Condition

Any system that cannot be exited
without justification
has already exceeded its mandate.

This note records withdrawal
as an affirmative human right.
