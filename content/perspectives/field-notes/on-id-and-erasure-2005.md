## 中文原文（2005）

語氣、詞彙、以及藏匿在句子中的思想，  
在 1 與 0 的空間中交織出一個網路人格。  
於是我確信我真的從一篇篇的觀想，  
漸漸描繪出一個概略的輪廓，認識了你。  
只是你永遠是那樣的模糊不清晰，  
你終究只是個 ID。

<!-- more -->

而我也靠著一次又一次的貼文，  
雕塑出一個網路人格，讓別人認識部分的我，  
這也終究只是個 ID。  

或許有天醒來，  
突然拋開上頭承載的人格、信譽、人際關係，  
重新註冊一個 ID，重新開始。  
那，這算不算一個生命的死亡？

是不是一個 ID 誕生得太容易，  
所以學會了說話不負責，  
久而久之也將這個惡習，  
從虛擬中帶進現實？

我們處於一個尷尬的年代，  
徘徊在虛擬與真實之間。

## English Translation

Tone, vocabulary, and the thoughts hidden within sentences  
interweave in the space between ones and zeros,  
forming an online persona.

Through post after post,  
I became convinced that I was gradually outlining a rough silhouette—  
that I had come to recognize *you*.  
Yet you always remained indistinct, unresolved.  
In the end, you were only an ID.

<!-- more -->

Through repeated writing,  
I too sculpted an online persona,  
allowing others to know fragments of who I was.  
And this, too, was only an ID.

Perhaps one day, upon waking,  
one could discard the accumulated persona—  
its reputation, its relationships—  
and simply register a new ID,  
begin again.

Would that count as the death of a life?

Is it because IDs are born too easily  
that speech learns to evade responsibility,  
and over time, this habit is carried  
from the virtual world into reality?

We inhabit an awkward era,  
hovering between the virtual and the real.
