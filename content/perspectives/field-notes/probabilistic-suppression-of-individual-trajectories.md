title: Probabilistic Suppression of Individual Trajectories

## Observation

Language models optimize for likelihood.
They surface what is statistically common,
not what is situationally precise.

This mechanism is often invisible to users.
It manifests as “reasonable advice.”

---

## Failure Mode

Across many domains,
outputs converge toward similar conclusions:

- disengage,
- move on,
- accept closure,
- choose the safer path.

Individual cases are not rejected.
They are diluted.

Edge trajectories disappear
through probability, not argument.

---

## Scope

This effect is not limited to relationships.

It appears in:
- entrepreneurship,
- ethical dissent,
- institutional conflict,
- and minority life paths.

What is rare is treated as noise.
What is common becomes normative.

---

## Boundary Condition

Statistical dominance is not wisdom.

A system that cannot preserve low-probability paths
cannot claim to support human uniqueness.

This note records how individuality
is suppressed without ever being named.
