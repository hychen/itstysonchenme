## Abstract

This note records an early operational observation (December 2022)  
on how large language models alter human work *not by replacing labor*,  
but by shifting humans from execution to **delegation, constraint setting, and judgment**.

At the time of writing, the language of “agents,” “AI workforce,” or “task orchestration”
was not yet mainstream.  
The observations below precede those terms, but describe the same structural shift.

---

## A Common Misreading

When ChatGPT became publicly available, most early reactions fell into two camps:

1. Treating it as a **content generator**
2. Treating it as a **search engine replacement**

Both approaches miss its primary affordance.

Used this way, ChatGPT appears unreliable:
- mediocre at factual recall
- weak at up-to-date information
- verbose and imprecise for production content

This led to premature conclusions:
- “AI content is low quality”
- “This will cause misinformation”
- “Certain jobs will disappear”

These reactions overestimate surface capabilities  
while underestimating *structural* ones.

---

## The Actual Shift: From Doing to Delegating

The more consequential change is not *what* ChatGPT produces,  
but *how humans position themselves relative to it*.

The effective user is not a consumer of answers,  
but a **manager of partial tasks**.

In practice, this means:

- breaking work into delegable units
- specifying constraints and priorities
- iteratively correcting outputs
- deciding what *should not* be done

This is less like querying a tool  
and more like supervising a junior worker.

## Observed Usage Principles (2022)

Through repeated use, the following principles emerged.

These are not prompt tricks.  
They describe *task structure*.

### 1. Role Reframing

Treat the model as a continuously available junior worker.  
Treat yourself as responsible for:
- task definition
- scope limitation
- quality control

### 2. Time-Bound Delegation

Tasks that would take a human ~20 minutes or less  
produce the best results when delegated.

Long, vague assignments collapse into generic output.

### 3. Minimal Outputs First

Smaller, well-scoped outputs outperform large, abstract requests.

Precision emerges through iteration, not initial completeness.

### 4. Explicit Constraints

Equally important to stating what to do  
is stating what **must not** be done.

Priority ordering matters.

### 5. Continuous Guidance

The model does not share your mental model.

Correction is not failure; it is the core interaction loop.

### 6. Parallel Tasking

Multiple conversations enable parallel delegation,  
with the human acting as the synchronization layer.

### 7. Externalized Instruction

The model forgets.

Reusable instruction must be written down and reapplied.  
Operational memory belongs outside the model.

## What Actually Changes About Work

The shift is not automation replacing humans.

It is a reallocation of value:

- from execution → selection
- from production → judgment
- from output → responsibility

Humans increasingly decide:
- which tasks are worth doing
- which constraints apply
- which outputs are acceptable
- which results are endorsed

This is not a productivity hack.  
It is a role transition.

---

## Cost, Limits, and Reality

The future impact of such systems depends less on capability  
and more on **economic accessibility**.

High compute costs imply that:
- usage will be selective
- delegation skills will matter
- indiscriminate automation will be rare

The tool’s value lies where judgment is scarce,  
not where labor is cheap.

---

## Retrospective Note

In hindsight, this text describes  
an early form of **human–AI task delegation**.

Later terminology would frame this as:
- agent coordination
- workflow orchestration
- AI workforce design

At the time, it was simply a practical observation:

> When language becomes the interface,  
> human value shifts from parameter tuning  
> to narration, selection, and endorsement.

This note records that moment.
