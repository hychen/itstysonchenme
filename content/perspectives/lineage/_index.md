This section documents the conceptual origins, intellectual lineage, and theoretical underpinnings of semantic execution. It provides the historical and analytical context necessary for readers to understand how the current framework emerged.

Topics include:

- The transition from knowledge representation to semantic execution  
- Computable ontologies of agency, delegation, and responsibility  
- Theoretical structures that support completion semantics  
- The evolution of machine-interpretable governance models  

These documents do not prescribe architectures; they clarify the reasoning and traditions that shape them.
