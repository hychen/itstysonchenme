summary: "Structural characteristics of an economy organized around semantic execution and machine-interpretable work."
description: "This section outlines how semantic execution reconfigures production, coordination, and value formation. It identifies the conditions under which organizations transition from tool-centric workflows to AI-native execution models."

This section examines the economic structures that emerge when work becomes semantic, delegable, and machine-interpretable.

The AI-native economy differs from traditional software-driven productivity in that:

- execution is defined through semantic task chains  
- management shifts from intent expression to completion governance  
- responsibility becomes assignable across human–machine boundaries  
- work output becomes auditable and replayable  
- coordination cost declines as delegation becomes programmable  

These documents describe how semantic execution alters:

- production functions  
- organizational overhead  
- unit economics of knowledge work  
- distribution of expertise  
- the boundary between firm-level and machine-level execution  

The aim is to provide a structural view of the economic environment enabled by AI-native management and semantic execution systems.
