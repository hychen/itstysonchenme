This section examines the economic logic of enterprise procurement in the context of AI-native execution.

Procurement functions operate under constraints that differ from traditional software acquisition.  
Semantic execution interacts with these constraints by providing:

- verifiable delegation  
- traceable responsibility transfer  
- reproducible task completion  
- machine-auditable execution logs  

These features change how organizations evaluate:

- vendor risk  
- compliance exposure  
- operational reliability  
- procurement cycles and approval gates  
- total cost of ownership for AI-driven workflows  

The documents here outline why semantic systems align with procurement logic and how they reshape enterprise purchasing decisions.
