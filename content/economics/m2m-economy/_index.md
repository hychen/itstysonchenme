This section explores the economic structures that arise when machines can transact, coordinate, and execute work autonomously.

A machine-to-machine economy requires:

- persistent machine identity  
- verifiable delegation  
- transferable responsibility  
- deterministic or replayable execution traces  
- enforceable semantic commitments  

Semantic execution provides the conditions under which machine agents can:

- negotiate tasks  
- allocate resources  
- coordinate workflows  
- settle obligations  
- participate in automated markets  

The documents here describe the economic mechanics enabled when delegation and execution become machine-interpretable and auditable.
