## Research Framework: From Theme to Practice

The core of my research is "Executable Semantic Order." My methodology is not a list of technical features, but rather a demonstration of how a clear central axis generates diverse implementation possibilities.

The entire framework unfolds in the order of "**Theme → Structure → Projection**":

1.  **Theme**: Defines the core problem: "How semantics become computable order."
2.  **Structure**: Establishes the core technical pillars required to realize this order.
3.  **Projection**: Shows how these structures manifest as specific products or system implementations in different application domains.
