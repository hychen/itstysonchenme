## Projection: Multi-Agent Governance

When a large number of autonomous AI agents (possibly from different organizations) need to collaborate or coexist in the same digital space, chaos and conflict are inevitable. The Multi-Agent Governance framework is a projection of "Executable Semantic Order" in addressing this systemic problem.

It is not a single piece of software but a combination of institutional design and technical implementation.

### Core Mechanisms

*   **Semantic Registry**: A public, trusted registry where all agents can publish their `AgentIDL` (semantic interfaces) and the public governance protocols they are willing to abide by (e.g., a semantic framework for data privacy).
*   **Dynamic Coalition Formation**: Agents can dynamically form "coalitions" based on shared goals or semantic commitments. Coalitions can share more detailed rules and trust relationships internally. For example, a "supply chain coalition" composed of logistics, warehousing, and retail agents.
*   **Layered Accountability Model**: When problems arise (e.g., a delayed shipment), the governance framework provides a layered accountability mechanism.
    1.  **Individual Responsibility**: First, trace back via the `Semantic Ledger` to identify which specific agent's behavior deviated from its commitment.
    2.  **Coalition Responsibility**: If the problem stems from a flaw in internal coalition rules, the coalition itself bears responsibility.
    3.  **Platform Responsibility**: If the problem is platform-level (e.g., a bug in the `Semantic OS`), the platform provider is responsible.
*   **Automated Dispute Resolution**: Minor semantic conflicts or violations can be automatically resolved by specialized "arbitration agents" based on predefined governance rules, without human intervention.

This framework aims to transform a chaotic "agent society" into an ordered, efficient, and clearly accountable "agent economy."
