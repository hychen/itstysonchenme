## Projection Layer

If the "Structure Layer" is the engine of semantic order, then the "Projection Layer" consists of the various vehicles powered by this engine. This layer demonstrates how specific products or system forms emerge when the theory of "Executable Semantic Order" is applied to different domains.

These projections are not the main axis of research themselves, but rather **application instances** of the main axis in the real world. They allow visitors to immediately understand how an abstract computational model can give rise to concrete, valuable solutions.

### Key Projection Instances

*   [**Semantic OS**](./semantic-os/)
    An operating system that incorporates semantic integrity as a core function.

*   [**Agent Execution Model**](./agent-execution/)
    A model that provides a secure and predictable execution environment for autonomous agents.

*   [**Multi-Agent Governance**](./governance/)
    A framework for establishing rules and responsibilities in systems composed of multiple independent agents.

*   [**AI Workforce Systems**](./ai-workforce/)
    Systems that organize AI agents into an efficient, collaborative workforce.

*   **Identity-native Computation**
    An emerging computational paradigm where every computational task is tied to a native, verifiable digital identity.
