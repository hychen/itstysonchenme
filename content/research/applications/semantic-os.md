## Projection: Semantic OS

The Semantic OS is a product that implements the philosophy of "Executable Semantic Order" at the operating system level. It not only manages hardware resources (CPU, memory) but, more importantly, treats **Semantic Integrity** as a first-class citizen.

### Core Features

*   **Semantic Scheduler**: The OS scheduler considers not only process priority but also verifies whether the process (or agent) behavior aligns with its declared semantic commitments. Processes violating semantics may be demoted, suspended, or even terminated.
*   **Identity-Based Resource Access**: All requests for file, network, or device access must originate from an agent with a verifiable identity and comply with its granted semantic permissions.
*   **Kernel-Level Semantic Ledger Client**: The OS kernel directly interacts with the Semantic Ledger, registering critical system events (e.g., process creation, permission changes) on the ledger, providing a very high level of system audibility.
*   **Semantic Sandbox**: Provides an execution environment for untrusted agents that enforces strict semantic constraints, ensuring their behavior does not exceed expected boundaries.

The goal of Semantic OS is to fundamentally create a safer, more predictable, and more accountable computing environment.
