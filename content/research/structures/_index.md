## Structure Layer

To achieve "Executable Semantic Order," I propose a set of four core components. These structures collectively provide the foundational framework for semantic computation, orchestration, verification, and traceability. This layer is more in-depth, primarily intended for researchers and developers to understand the technical core of the order.

### Four Core Structures

1.  [**Semantic ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)**](./semantic-isa/)
    A semantic instruction set that defines the executable primitives of the semantic order.

2.  [**AgentIDL (Agent Interface Definition Language)**](./agentidl/)
    A semantic interface layer that provides an orchestration interface for the semantic order.

3.  [**Identity & Memory Architecture**](./identity/)
    The subject framework for the order, encompassing identity and memory management for agents.

4.  [**Semantic Ledger**](./ledger/)
    A semantic ledger providing a traceable mechanism for the order.
