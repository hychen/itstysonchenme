## AgentIDL: Semantic Interface Layer

Agent Interface Definition Language (AgentIDL) is examined as a **semantic interface layer** through which agent capabilities and commitments can be expressed, discovered, and composed without reference to internal implementation details.

Within the research, AgentIDL is treated as a structural mechanism for exploring how heterogeneous agents may participate in shared execution environments while remaining independently constructed and governed.

---

## Structural Role

Rather than operating as a programming language in the conventional sense, AgentIDL functions as a **declarative interface structure** situated between semantic intent and executable coordination.

It addresses the question of how agent behavior can be exposed, constrained, and combined at the level of meaning rather than code.

---

## Functional Dimensions

### Capability Expression

AgentIDL provides a structured way for agents to declare the **semantic capabilities** they are prepared to participate in, without revealing internal mechanisms.

Such declarations define the *scope of admissible action* rather than guaranteeing execution strategy.

---

### Interface Explicitness

By making semantic commitments explicit at the interface boundary, AgentIDL clarifies:
- which forms of interaction are semantically admissible,
- how responsibilities are demarcated across agents,
- and where execution boundaries reside.

This clarificatory role becomes critical when agents originate from different authors, organizations, or runtime environments.

---

### Compositional Coordination

AgentIDL supports the compositional arrangement of agent capabilities into larger execution structures.

Coordination here is treated as an exercise in **semantic compatibility**, not procedural control.
The emphasis lies on whether declared commitments may be safely composed, rather than on how orchestration is implemented.

---

## Scope Boundary

AgentIDL is not presented as a finalized specification or interoperability standard.

It is used as a **conceptual and structural device** within the research to examine how semantic interfaces might support coordination, responsibility allocation, and verification in multi-agent systems.

---

AgentIDL serves as an interface lens through which executable semantic order can be explored at the boundary between independent systems.
