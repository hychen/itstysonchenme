## Semantic Ledger: Trace Structures

Executable semantic order presupposes that meaningful actions remain **traceable beyond the moment of execution**.

Within the research, the Semantic Ledger is examined as a **trace structure** through which semantic commitments, interactions, and attribution events may be recorded in an externally inspectable manner.

It is not treated as a financial ledger or consensus system, but as a structural mechanism for accountability.

---

## Structural Perspective

When semantic commitments participate in execution, the question of *recording* becomes inseparable from the question of *responsibility*.

From this perspective, a ledger structure functions to:
- preserve evidence of declared commitments,
- retain traces of interaction and execution,
- and support later verification independent of model internals.

The emphasis lies on **inspectability and persistence**, not on economic exchange.

---

## Classes of Recorded Events

At the structural level, a semantic ledger is concerned with recording events such as:

### Commitment Declarations

Records that capture when a subject publicly enters a semantic commitment, together with contextual information necessary for later interpretation.

---

### Inter-Agent Semantic Interactions

Records associated with semantically meaningful interactions across agents, where declared interfaces or commitments are invoked.

These interactions are recorded as *events of relevance*, not as low-level execution logs.

---

### Verification Outcomes

Records indicating whether observed behavior aligns with previously declared semantic commitments.

The ledger does not prescribe *how* verification is performed, but preserves the outcome as an inspectable artifact.

---

### Attribution Events

Records that associate specific actions or violations with identifiable subjects.

Such records support post-hoc reasoning about responsibility without assuming perfect foresight or centralized control.

---

## Structural Role and Limits

The Semantic Ledger is not proposed as:
- a universal blockchain,
- a consensus protocol,
- or a complete governance mechanism.

It functions as a **structural support** through which accountability and traceability may be expressed within executable semantic order.

Design choices concerning distribution, immutability, and trust anchors are treated as implementation-dependent.

- Interface and composition → see [AgentIDL]({{< ref "agentidl.md" >}})  
- Subject and attribution → see [Identity and Memory]({{< ref "identity.md" >}})

This section delineates how semantic actions may remain externally accountable without presupposing specific institutional arrangements.
