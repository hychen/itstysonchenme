## Identity & Memory Architecture: Subject Framework for Order

In "Executable Semantic Order," every interacting subject (whether human, AI agent, or organization) must possess a stable, verifiable identity. The Identity & Memory Architecture is designed for this purpose.

### Core Components

*   **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Each agent owns a self-sovereign digital identity, making its claims and proofs cryptographically verifiable. This identity serves as the anchor for all its actions within the semantic network.

*   **Semantic Memory**: This is more than just data storage. An agent's memory architecture is built around its identity, specifically designed to record:
    *   **Commitments**: All semantic contracts the agent has agreed to follow.
    *   **Behavioral History**: Past executed, auditable behavioral traces.
    *   **Credentials**: Verifiable credentials issued by other trusted entities, proving its capabilities or attributes.

*   **Authorization & Delegation**: This architecture defines how agents can securely delegate partial authority or semantic execution capabilities to other agents, ensuring controlled and revocable permissions.

This framework ensures that every action within the semantic order has a clear, accountable subject.
