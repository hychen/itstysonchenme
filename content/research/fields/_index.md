# Research Fields

The research program is organized around a set of foundational fields that specify the **conceptual perimeter**, **structural assumptions**, and **problem classes** relevant to executable semantic systems.

These fields do not function as topics or categories.  
They define the *disciplinary structure* within which semantic order, syntactic coordination, and multi-agent execution can be examined as **governable and formally constrained phenomena**.

The fields operate as stable points of reference for theoretical work, structural analysis, and system projection.

# Field Structure

The research program is articulated across four major field groups:

- **Domains** — conceptual foundations and high-level semantic constructs  
- **Structures** — primitives and mechanisms enabling semantic execution  
- **Applications** — system-level projections under real constraints  
- **Order** — the foundational analytic frame for executable semantics  

Each group contains multiple research fields, each addressing a distinct dimension of semantic execution.

---

## Domains  
Conceptual foundations and semantic–syntactic conditions that govern meaning as a structural material.

These domains define recurrent forms and problem structures observable across semantic systems.

→ See [Domains]({{< ref "domains/_index.md" >}})

---

## Structures  
Constituent primitives and architectural elements required for executable semantics.

These fields specify:

- instruction layers  
- identity and memory structures  
- delegation paths  
- audit and traceability constraints  

→ See [Structures]({{< ref "structures/_index.md" >}})

---

## Applications  
System-level projections that arise when semantic order and structural primitives are placed under operational, institutional, or multi-agent constraints.

These fields address:

- agent execution models  
- operating environments  
- governance structures  
- enterprise and cross-border systems  

→ See [Applications]({{< ref "applications/_index.md" >}})

---

## Order  
The foundational analytic condition underlying all other fields.

This field investigates how semantic order can function as:

- a computational constraint  
- a governance substrate  
- a material for system construction  

→ See [Semantic Order]({{< ref "order/_index.md" >}})

# Field Orientation

The research fields define the **disciplinary grammar** of this program.  
They specify what counts as a valid problem, what structural assumptions must be preserved, and how semantic constraints can be analyzed across varying environments.

Individual papers, notes, and analyses map to these fields according to the structural questions they address, not according to application or topic.

The fields thus operate as **anchor points** for a developing research discipline concerned with executable semantics, syntactic coordination, and multi-agent computational governance.
