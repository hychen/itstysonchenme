When executable semantic order is examined at the level of autonomous agents, it becomes visible as a characteristic **agent execution model**.

This projection addresses a core question:
how can an autonomous agent act persistently in an open environment while remaining attributable, bounded, and verifiable?

The model is treated as an analytical construct rather than a prescriptive design.

## Structural Aspects

From a structural perspective, agent execution under semantic constraint exhibits several recurring requirements.

### Execution Boundary

Agent behavior presupposes a bounded execution environment.

Such boundaries:
- isolate agent behavior from unintended side effects,
- provide a locus for semantic enforcement,
- and separate internal inference from externally accountable actions.

This boundary functions as a semantic containment mechanism rather than a purely technical sandbox.

---

### Intent-to-Execution Mediation

Executable semantic order requires that abstract intent not collapse directly into procedural action.

A mediation layer is therefore observed at which:
- semantic intent is articulated in executable form,
- mappings to operational primitives remain inspectable,
- and deviations between intent and behavior become detectable.

This mediation establishes continuity between meaning and action.

---

### Behavioral Trace and Verification

Agent execution under semantic constraint generates observable traces.

These traces support:
- verification of alignment with semantic commitments,
- post-hoc audit of executed behavior,
- and attribution of responsibility across execution steps.

Such traceability is treated as an inherent property of execution, not an auxiliary monitoring feature.

---

### Capability Scope and Delegation

Capabilities in this execution model are not treated as static agent properties.

Instead, execution requires:
- scoped, revocable capabilities,
- explicit delegation boundaries,
- and temporal limitation of authority.

This structure enables agents to act effectively without accumulating unchecked power.

---

## Relation to Trust and Compliance

When viewed collectively, these aspects constitute a shift from static trust assumptions toward continuous verification.

Agent execution under executable semantic order is therefore examined as a condition for:
- persistent trust,
- operational safety,
- and systemic accountability.
