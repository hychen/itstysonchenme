## Scope

Semantic OS refers to an **operating-environment form** that becomes visible when executable semantic order is examined at the level of persistent execution.

It is not introduced as an operating system product, nor as a software platform.
Instead, it designates a **structural transformation** in how execution environments are conceptualized once semantic legitimacy participates directly in execution.

This page serves as the **entry point** to the Semantic OS research application domain.

## Conceptual Framing

When executable semantic order is treated as a foundational constraint rather than an auxiliary mechanism, the assumptions underlying traditional operating systems are structurally altered.

In this framing:

- execution is no longer evaluated solely by computational correctness,
- authority is no longer reducible to static permission models,
- and system behavior becomes inseparable from questions of semantic admissibility.

Semantic OS names this altered operating-environment condition.

AI-Native Management operates as the management layer corresponding to such environments.

## Structural Perspective

Traditional operating systems are designed to manage computational resources.

Executable semantic order introduces an additional constraint:  
**semantic legitimacy of action**.

When this constraint is taken seriously, the role of the operating environment shifts from resource coordination toward **semantic boundary enforcement**.

## Observable Structural Shifts

### Semantic-Aware Scheduling

Execution is no longer ordered solely by priority, fairness, or resource availability.

Under semantic order, scheduling encounters questions such as:
- whether an executing entity remains within its declared scope,
- whether its current action is admissible under existing commitments,
- how violations are detected and resolved at execution time.

Scheduling thus becomes entangled with semantic validity rather than remaining a neutral optimization problem.

---

### Identity-Constrained Resource Access

Resource access presupposes an acting subject.

Within a semantic operating environment, access control is examined as:
- identity-scoped rather than process-scoped,
- constrained by declared authority rather than static permissions,
- attributable to accountable subjects rather than anonymous execution units.

Authority enforcement is therefore treated as a semantic condition of execution.

---

### Event Traceability at the Execution Layer

As execution becomes semantically constrained, the recording of execution-relevant events becomes structurally necessary.

These events include:
- changes in execution context,
- transitions of authority,
- boundary-crossing operations.

Traceability at this level enables verification and accountability without reliance on post hoc reconstruction.

---

### Constrained Execution Environments

Executable semantic order requires execution environments that admit bounded behavior.

Such environments:
- limit the effects of untrusted or partially trusted entities,
- enforce declared semantic boundaries,
- preserve system integrity under heterogeneous agent interaction.

Constraint here functions as a prerequisite for open execution, not as an optional security feature.
