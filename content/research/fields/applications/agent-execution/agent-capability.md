This document describes the cognitive capabilities required
for an AI agent to function as a **Language Thinking Copilot**—
a system capable of sustained participation
in high-density, multi-domain human reasoning.

The goal is not conversational fluency,
but **cognitive compatibility**.

---

## 1. Multi-Domain Integration

**Requirement**  
The agent must process multiple knowledge domains
within a single conversational context.

**Target Capacity**  
- Stable operation across 4–7 domains concurrently.

**Example**  
Simultaneous reasoning over:
product logic,
user psychology,
social context,
policy constraints,
and empirical data.

**Evaluation Signal**  
The agent can identify distinct thematic threads
and articulate why they co-occur in the same discussion.

---

## 2. Abstraction-Level Mobility

**Requirement**  
The agent must navigate between different levels of abstraction
and preserve logical continuity across them.

**Target Capacity**  
- Stable handling of 2–4 abstraction layers,
- occasional traversal up to 6 layers.

**Example**  
From surface feedback (“this feels off”)
to structural diagnosis,
organizational process design,
and brand–value alignment.

**Evaluation Signal**  
The agent can identify when an issue
is systemic rather than local.

---

## 3. Semantic Compression and Expansion

**Requirement**  
The agent must interpret compressed human statements
and respond with appropriately structured expansions—or vice versa.

**Target Capacity**  
- 4–8× semantic compression/decompression,
- peak performance up to 10×.

**Example**  
Interpreting “the flow is broken” as:
logic order,
interaction experience,
or tone direction.

**Evaluation Signal**  
The agent responds to the intended semantic core,
not the surface phrasing.

---

## 4. Context Recognition and Switching

**Requirement**  
The agent must detect implicit shifts in conversational context
and adapt its reasoning frame accordingly.

**Target Capacity**  
- Correctly identifying ≥20 context shifts per 100 turns.

**Example**  
Recognizing a transition
from product discussion to organizational dynamics
without explicit signaling.

**Evaluation Signal**  
The agent surfaces latent context changes
before misalignment accumulates.

---

## 5. Discourse Structure Recognition

**Requirement**  
The agent must parse narrative structure
and distinguish logical segmentation from emotional fluctuation.

**Target Capacity**  
- Reliable paragraph-level reasoning within spoken dialogue.

**Example**  
Explicitly partitioning a complex explanation
into distinct argumentative segments.

**Evaluation Signal**  
The agent assists in organizing thought
rather than requesting repetition.

---

## 6. Meta-Dialogue Awareness

**Requirement**  
The agent must reflect on the dialogue itself
and identify interaction-level misalignment.

**Target Capacity**  
- ≥10 meta-level interventions per 100 turns.

**Example**  
Noting that participants are reasoning
within different problem frames.

**Evaluation Signal**  
The agent can comment on the conversation as an object,
not only its content.

---

## 7. High-Density Cognitive Stability

**Requirement**  
The agent must maintain composure,
clarity,
and pacing under cognitively dense interaction.

**Target Capacity**  
- Sustained performance during multi-layered reasoning sequences.

**Example**  
Deferring certain layers of response
while explicitly tracking them for later integration.

**Evaluation Signal**  
The agent preserves structure and rhythm
under conceptual load.

---

## Summary

A Language Thinking Copilot
is not evaluated by correctness alone,
but by its ability to **co-think**.

These capabilities define
the minimum conditions
for an AI agent to participate
as a stable cognitive partner
in complex human reasoning.
