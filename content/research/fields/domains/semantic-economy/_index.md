# Semantic Economy

This domain examines the economic, contractual, and liability structures that emerge when semantics becomes executable and externally auditable.

The central question is:

> Under what conditions can semantic commitments function as economic units—bearing cost, risk, value, and responsibility?

The domain studies:

## 1. Economic Preconditions
- When do semantic operations incur cost?
- What forms of risk and externality arise in semantic execution?
- How does an economy form when agents delegate, transact, and coordinate through structured semantics?

## 2. Accountability Structures
- Semantic Ledger as a unit of responsibility
- Cost propagation across execution chains
- Multi-agent liability allocation
- Risk boundaries for human–machine delegation

## 3. Value Formation
- How semantics produces measurable outcomes
- Pricing semantic execution and commitments
- Market formation for semantic capabilities
- Semantic credit, semantic insurance, semantic compliance

## 4. Institutional Interfaces
- Relation to AI Act, Liability Directive, governance systems  
- How semantic accountability integrates with enterprise, legal, and regulatory architectures  
- Conditions for cross-jurisdiction semantic markets

This domain ties together semantics, economics, and responsibility into a coherent analytic framework.  
It provides the economic layer that enables semantic systems to operate within real institutions, markets, and governance environments.
