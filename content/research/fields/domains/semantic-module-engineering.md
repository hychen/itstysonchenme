Semantic Module Engineering treats linguistic units as engineered components that can be composed, constrained, and governed within larger semantic systems.  

A semantic module is defined as a bounded, operationally meaningful unit of language equipped with:

- constraints on interpretation;  
- an authorized tone or register;  
- explicit preconditions or postconditions;  
- compositional interfaces to adjacent modules;  
- delegation or permission properties.

Whereas natural language processing focuses on statistical modeling and linguistics emphasizes descriptive analysis, neither field provides a framework for constructing modular, verifiable semantic components suitable for institutional execution or multi-agent coordination.

This domain therefore develops the principles, design patterns, and governance structures required for modular semantic systems, including those involved in Semantic ISA, agent interfaces, and distributed semantic protocols.
