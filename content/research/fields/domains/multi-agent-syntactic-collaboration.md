Multi-Agent Syntactic Collaboration examines coordination among heterogeneous agents—human or artificial—through shared syntactic structures and semantically governed protocols.  
The domain posits that stable collaboration requires syntactic alignment rather than shared intention or behavioral similarity.

Core research questions include:

- how syntactic structures encode delegation, authorization, and revocation;  
- the design of semantic contracts that govern inter-agent commitments;  
- how collaborative reliability emerges from auditability and replayability;  
- the prevention and resolution of semantic drift in multi-agent ecosystems;  
- why existing paradigms in AI ethics, multi-agent systems, or distributed computing do not provide mechanisms for semantic authority.

This domain contributes a formal account of collaboration that is grounded in language-based governance rather than in normative abstractions or implementation-specific mechanisms.
