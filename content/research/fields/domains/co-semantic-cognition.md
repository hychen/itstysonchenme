Co-Semantic Cognition studies the formation, stabilization, and transformation of meaning across interactions between human and artificial cognitive systems.  
It examines how semantic structures become shared, how they evolve, and how authority over meaning is allocated or contested.

Primary areas of investigation include:

- mechanisms by which agents converge on shared semantic interpretations;  
- governance structures that regulate semantic consistency while permitting adaptive change;  
- models of authority and responsibility in jointly constructed semantic systems;  
- the dynamics of semantic drift and methods for its containment;  
- the conditions under which semantic models become verifiable, negotiable, and executable.

This domain fills a theoretical gap left by philosophy (limited verification), cognitive science (focus on individual cognition), and machine learning (lack of semantic governance).  

It provides the cognitive and epistemic foundation for semantic systems capable of supporting institutional and multi-agent execution.
