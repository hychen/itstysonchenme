This section presents six interrelated research domains that collectively define an integrated program in semantic systems and syntactic governance.  

The domains examine language as an operational substrate for institutions, collaboration, cognition, and engineered systems. 
Each domain outlines a distinct theoretical problem space while contributing to a broader agenda:  

**the development of AI-native institutional structures grounded in formal semantics and executable syntax.**

The conceptualization of these domains is preliminary; their number and nomenclature are subject to refinement as the research program evolves.
