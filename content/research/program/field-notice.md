# Research Field Notice

This research program defines a field of inquiry in which semantic structures are examined as executable, governable, and formally constrained conditions.

Readers are free to study, reference, critique, or develop independent work inspired by these materials.  
However, any work that claims to be *based on*, *derived from*, or *aligned with* this research program is expected to preserve:

- the underlying semantic assumptions,  
- the problem boundaries defined by the six domains, and  
- the conditions required for executable semantic order.

Reinterpretation, rebranding, or systematization that materially alters these assumptions should not be presented as an extension of this research.

Some materials may also be subject to additional usage constraints, including restrictions on automated or AI-mediated use, as specified under the Language Ontology License (LOL v0.1).
