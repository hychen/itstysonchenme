This section presents a research program concerned with the conditions under which semantics becomes executable, governable, and economically accountable.  

It provides the conceptual substrate that precedes the structural analyses in the *Research* section of this site.

The program is organized across **seven foundational domains**, covering institutional, syntactic, engineering, collaborative, ecological, cognitive, and economic dimensions of semantic systems.
