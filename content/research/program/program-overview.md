# Program Overview

This research program examines semantic systems as **formal, executable structures** capable of constraining behavior, distributing authority, and enabling coordination within computational and institutional environments.

The program does not treat language as a descriptive or communicative medium.  
It approaches language as a **structural substrate** in which permissions, commitments, inference paths, and operational boundaries can be encoded, executed, and inspected.

The central question is:

> Under what structural and institutional conditions can semantics serve as an executable order?

To answer this question, the program organizes inquiry across seven interrelated domains:

- **Semantic Institutional Design**  
- **Syntactic Entrepreneurship**  
- **Semantic Module Engineering**  
- **Multi-Agent Syntactic Collaboration**  
- **Language Habitat & Rhythm Governance**  
- **Co-Semantic Cognition**
- **Semantic Economy**

These domains constitute the theoretical framework through which executable semantic order is examined.  
They also supply the criteria by which semantic systems can be evaluated for stability, traceability, and governance potential.

The structural analyses presented in the *Research* section—covering semantic order, primitives, and system projections—should be viewed as **derived investigations** within this broader program, not as isolated theoretical artifacts.

The purpose of the program is to establish:

1. A coherent conceptual basis for semantic systems.  
2. The conditions for executable semantics.  
3. A boundary framework distinguishing this field from adjacent and legacy disciplines.  
4. A stable foundation for technical, institutional, and multi-agent implementations.
