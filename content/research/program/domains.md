# Research Domains

Semantic Systems Research is organized across seven foundational domains.  
Each domain defines a distinct problem set that cannot be absorbed into existing disciplines without distorting its assumptions or collapsing its structural aims.

---

## 1. Semantic Institutional Design

**Scope**  
Language as institutional material.  
Semantic structures as carriers of authority, delegation, and responsibility.

**Core Problem**  
Legal theory and political science cannot express chain-of-semantics governance;  
computer science provides protocol logic but no language-level authority model.

**Boundary**  
Not jurisprudence; not protocol engineering.  
This domain establishes the institutional preconditions for executable semantics.

---

## 2. Syntactic Entrepreneurship

**Scope**  
Language architectures as engines of entrepreneurial formation.  
Syntax as a generator of business structure, operational logic, and product identity.

**Core Problem**  
Entrepreneurship studies focus on tools and methods, not the syntactic construction of ventures.

**Boundary**  
Not management science; not linguistics.  
This domain examines the structural relation between syntactic design and venture creation.

---

## 3. Semantic Module Engineering

**Scope**  
Language modules as engineering components.  
Design of controllable, composable, and authorizable semantic units and tonal behaviors.

**Core Problem**  
Software engineering lacks a model for modular semantics;  
NLP lacks authority, tone, or semantic state as first-class constructs.

**Boundary**  
Not HCI; not prompt engineering.  
This domain treats modular semantics as an engineering substrate.

---

## 4. Multi-Agent Syntactic Collaboration

**Scope**  
Collaboration among humans and AI agents through syntactic commitments, permissions, and shared semantic structures.

**Core Problem**  
AI research concentrates on single-model capability;  
ethical frameworks address norms, not syntactic cooperation.

**Boundary**  
Not AI ethics; not multi-agent RL.  
This domain analyzes the structural mechanisms of language-mediated collaboration.

---

## 5. Language Habitat & Rhythm Governance

**Scope**  
The operational stability conditions of language systems:  
semantic damping, descent mechanisms, and rhythm governance.

**Core Problem**  
Linguistics lacks notions of operational rhythm or semantic load management;  
psychology is individual rather than systemic.

**Boundary**  
Not discourse analysis.  
This domain studies the stability constraints required for durable semantic operation.

---

## 6. Co-Semantic Cognition

**Scope**  
How semantics is jointly generated, stabilized, and shared across heterogeneous minds—human or machine.

**Core Problem**  
Philosophy studies meaning; cognitive science studies individuals;  
neither provides machinery for shared semantic agency or distributed cognition.

**Boundary**  
Not philosophy of language.  
This domain defines the cognitive preconditions for semantic co-construction.

---

## 7. Semantic Economy

**Scope**  
The economic structure of semantic action:  
commitment cost, semantic credit, responsibility flow, and value formation.

Semantic behavior is treated as a unit of economic consequence—  
verifiable, accountable, transferable, and measurable.

**Core Problem**  
Economics models behavior and price;  
blockchain models transactions and consensus;  
neither addresses **semantic commitments** as economic primitives.

Semantic Ledger, semantic cost models, liability structures, and agent-level settlement mechanisms all belong here.

**Boundary**  
Not mechanism design; not token economics; not blockchain research.  
This domain defines the economic primitives of semantic systems and the conditions under which meaning participates in value, cost, and accountability.

---

# Purpose of the Domain Framework

The seven domains provide the theoretical substrate for Semantic Systems Research.  
They define the problem boundaries, structural assumptions, and analytical commitments required for examining semantics as an executable order.

They also serve as the reference structure for evaluating coherence across:

- semantic institutions  
- syntactic entrepreneurial formations  
- semantic engineering systems  
- multi-agent cooperation models  
- operational stability mechanisms  
- cognitive co-construction  
- semantic economic flows  

The domains form the conceptual foundation for the structural analyses documented in the *Research* section of this site.
