## Theme: Executable Semantic Order

"Executable Semantic Order" is the central idea of my research. It explores how abstract "semantics" can be transformed into concrete, operable elements within a system, making them not just interpretations of data, but the very foundation of behavior.

This theme primarily defines three core areas:

*   **How Semantics Become Constraints**
    Investigating how semantics transition from passive labels to active rules, directly imposing limitations on the behavior space of machines and agents, ensuring their operation aligns with an intended framework of meaning.

*   **How Semantics Form a Verifiable Basis for Behavior**
    Exploring behavioral models built upon semantic commitments. When an agent or system claims to adhere to certain semantics, we need mechanisms to verify that its subsequent actions are consistent with that declaration.

*   **How Semantics Form Computation**
    Viewing the transformation, inference, and composition of semantics as a new computational process. This is not merely data processing, but computation centered around "meaning" itself, providing a basis for achieving higher levels of machine intelligence.
