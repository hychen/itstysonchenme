## Standards & Governance: Bringing Semantic Order to Institutions

The value of technology is ultimately reflected in how it integrates with existing institutions and drives their evolution. A core objective of "Executable Semantic Order" is to provide a solid, verifiable technical foundation for the rapidly developing AI field, supporting future governance frameworks.

This page demonstrates how my research interacts with global standardization organizations and governance initiatives.

### 4.1 Roles & Participation

I primarily contribute my research in the following areas:

*   **W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)**:
    Participating in the `Credentials Community Group (CCG)` and `Decentralized Identifier Working Group (DID WG)`. My main contribution focuses on **Agent's Semantic Communication**: how agents with DIDs can use Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to exchange and verify each other's semantic commitments.

*   **Linux Foundation (LF)**:
    Within the open-source community, I promote reference implementations of the **Semantic Execution Layer**. The goal is to establish a neutral, widely adoptable open-source framework that allows AI products from different companies to interoperate on a common semantic foundation.

*   **EUDI Wallet (European Digital Identity Wallet)**:
    My research provides a theoretical model for the application of the EUDI Wallet in the age of AI. Especially in **Identity & Authorization Models**, it explores how the European Digital Identity Wallet can become a key infrastructure for individuals to authorize actions by their AI agents.

*   **Other Initiatives**:
    Monitoring and participating in discussions concerning AI compliance frameworks, Algorithmic Accountability models, and providing feasibility analyses from a technical perspective based on semantic order.

### 4.2 Institutional Observations

*   **How Semantic Order Provides Auditable AI**:
    The "black box" nature of traditional AI is a major governance obstacle. The recording mechanism based on the `Semantic Ledger` makes AI's decision-making chain transparent and immutable, providing a technical prerequisite for regulation and accountability.

*   **Responsibility Allocation in Multi-Agent Systems**:
    When a task performed collaboratively by multiple AIs goes wrong, how is responsibility allocated? Semantic order provides a clear path for attribution by recording each agent's "semantic commitment" and "actual behavior."

*   **Compliance & The Semantic Ledger**:
    Enterprise compliance policies (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) can be encoded into standardized "compliance semantic graphs." The system can automatically verify that AI behavior consistently adheres to these graphs, and record verification results on the semantic ledger, thereby greatly simplifying compliance processes.
