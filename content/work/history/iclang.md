ICLang was an early experimental system investigating coordination languages and process composition in distributed environments.

The project explored whether heterogeneous processes could be composed and executed through explicit coordination structures, without requiring semantic interpretation of their internal logic. Each process was treated as a black box, constrained only by its input–output behavior and communication patterns.

At the time, the system was motivated by practical questions around orchestration and service composition. In retrospect, it articulated an implicit structural intuition: execution order and behavioral constraints can be defined independently of understanding, intention, or interpretation.

This work does not constitute a precursor or early version of my current research. Rather, it represents an exploratory stage prior to the formulation of executable semantic order as an explicit ontological and theoretical framework.
