title: "Historical Work"

This section documents earlier systems and experiments that informed, but do not constitute, my current research.

These projects were developed prior to the formal articulation of my present theoretical framework. They should not be read as implementations of that framework, but as exploratory systems that surfaced persistent structural constraints later addressed explicitly.

They reflect early structural intuitions around execution, coordination, composition, and constraint, expressed across different layers of system interaction.

Taken together, these works trace a gradual progression—from human input mediation, to execution abstraction, to compositional execution order, falsification mechanisms, and coordination models.  

Each stage exposed limitations that could not be resolved at the level of tooling or workflow alone, ultimately necessitating a semantic and ontological formulation rather than merely preceding it.
