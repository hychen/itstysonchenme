Kuansim was a civic technology project initiated within the g0v community to address the persistence of public attention on social and political issues.

Rather than competing with news media on immediacy or coverage, the platform was designed around follow-up as a first-class structure. Issues introduced on Kuansim were intentionally tracked over time, resisting the common pattern in which public discussion fades once mainstream attention shifts elsewhere.

The project treated attention as a finite and fragile resource, requiring structural support to be sustained. By organizing commentary, ongoing updates, and solution-oriented discussion within a single platform, Kuansim explored how civic awareness could be made durable without assuming expert participation from users.

This work predates my later focus on executable systems and semantic constraints. It is documented here as an early investigation into persistence, traceability, and temporal structure in collective systems—problems that would later reappear in technical form within my research on execution and governance.
