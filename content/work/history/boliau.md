BoLiau was an early experimental framework for task and mission orchestration, developed to manage chained operations and deferred execution in script-based environments.

The system treated tasks as composable units, allowing workflows to be constructed through sequencing, continuation, and lazy execution. Individual tasks were considered operational black boxes, coordinated through explicit control structures rather than semantic interpretation.

At the time, the project addressed practical needs around workflow automation and batch operations. In retrospect, it reflects an early engagement with process composition and execution ordering, without yet articulating semantic constraints or ontological commitments.

This work is not part of my current research on executable semantic order. It represents a tooling-oriented exploration preceding the formalization of semantic execution as a theoretical and ontological problem.
