SenseTW was an open-source civic-tech project under the g0v community, aiming to build a long-term public-issue tracking and civic-participation platform.

Rather than being a typical news site, the project emphasized persistent attention, structured issue mapping, ongoing commentary, and collaborative documentation — seeking to prevent critical social and political issues from fading once media focus moves on.

The initiative explored how public awareness and communal memory could be sustained through digital infrastructure: by turning ephemeral discussions into persistent, structured, and shareable records.

This work predates any focus on executable systems or semantic constraints. It is documented here as an early civic-tech exploration of attention persistence and collective knowledge maintenance — a societal-level intuition parallel to later technical explorations of execution, governance, and semantic order.

It also marked my closest early engagement with knowledge representation in multi-agent settings, where differing backgrounds, asynchronous participation, and conflicting mental models revealed that many disagreements are not resolvable through facts alone, but require time, memory, and the coexistence of multiple perspectives.
