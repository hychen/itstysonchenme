## Papers & Notes

This section archives my publications, working papers, and research notes, organized along the central research axis of Executable Semantic Order.

*   **On the Axioms of Computable Ontology**
    *Abstract: This paper lays the foundational axioms for a system where ontological statements can be computationally verified and executed.*

*   **Notes on Semantic Generative Models**
    *Abstract: A collection of thoughts on models that don't just generate data, but generate structures of meaning that can be used to constrain system behavior.*

*   **The Lineage of a Semantic OS**
    *Abstract: Tracing the conceptual and technical history that leads to the design of a Semantic Operating System, from early context-aware computing to modern agent architectures.*

*   **Syntactic vs. Semantic Interoperability in Multi-Agent Collaboration**
    *Abstract: An analysis of the limitations of purely syntactic API contracts and a proposal for a semantic-first approach to enable more robust and flexible agent collaboration.*

*   **Commentary on W3C Verifiable Credentials and Agent Architecture**
    *Abstract: A presentation and summary of my work connecting the W3C standards for DIDs and VCs to a practical architecture for autonomous agents.*
