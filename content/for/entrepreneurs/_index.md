Entrepreneurs operate at the boundary
between decision and execution.

When semantic intent becomes executable,
this boundary shifts.

Delegation is no longer limited to people.
It extends to systems that act,
complete tasks,
and leave irreversible traces.

This introduces new responsibility conditions:

- founders must define what may be delegated
- execution authority must be bounded, not implicit
- failures reflect delegation design, not system intelligence
- accountability cannot be deferred to tools or models

This section describes the structural responsibilities
entrepreneurs assume
when permitting semantic execution,
and the conditions under which delegation
remains legitimate rather than evasive.
