# Semantic Execution for Developers

Developers require stable boundaries.

Semantic execution provides an instruction layer  
between natural language and operational behavior.  

Key components:

- Semantic ISA as an inspectable, replayable instruction set  
- Agent IDL as an interface between models and traditional runtimes  
- admissibility rules defining when execution is permitted  
- completion semantics defining how tasks reach terminal states  
- failure models for composite chains  

This section provides the technical structures developers rely on  
to build predictable, verifiable, and composable systems  
without depending on unrestricted model behavior.
