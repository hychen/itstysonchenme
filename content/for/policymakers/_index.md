# Semantic Execution for Policymakers

When semantic intent becomes executable,  
governance no longer addresses interpretation alone.  
It must address how commitments propagate through delegated tasks,  
how responsibility is assigned,  
and under what conditions an AI system is permitted to act.

This section describes the structural consequences for public policy:

- the admissibility conditions for executable semantics  
- delegation boundaries between human and machine actors  
- traceability requirements for composite task chains  
- stability criteria for AI-integrated public workflows  

These structures do not prescribe regulation.  
They describe the constraints under which policy can remain legitimate  
when execution is no longer human-exclusive.
