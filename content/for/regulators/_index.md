Regulatory systems depend on clarity of action,  
traceability of responsibility,  
and predictable pathways for redress.

Semantic execution introduces new conditions:

- actions triggered from semantic commitments  
- composite workflows executed through multiple agents  
- distributed responsibility over delegated tasks  
- verification of completion states  

This section defines the structural constraints without which
compliance frameworks cannot operate,
including admissibility rules, auditability requirements,
and the conditions required for safe deployment
under emerging AI regulatory regimes.
