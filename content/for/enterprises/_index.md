Enterprises operate through layered responsibility.

Execution is distributed across teams, systems,
vendors, and jurisdictions,
with accountability enforced through process, audit, and control.

Semantic execution alters this structure.

When semantic intent is permitted to trigger execution,
organizations must ensure that:

- execution boundaries remain explicit
- delegation does not dissolve responsibility
- actions are traceable across composite workflows
- completion states are verifiable and reviewable
- failures can be isolated without collapsing the whole system

This section defines the structural conditions
under which enterprises may allow semantic execution
to participate in operational workflows
without compromising governance, auditability,
or institutional accountability.
