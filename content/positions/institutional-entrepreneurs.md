Institutional entrepreneurs did not meaningfully exist in earlier historical periods.

The authority to write institutions — to define governance, legitimacy, liability, and enforcement —
was historically monopolized by states.

Entrepreneurship operated within institutional boundaries.
It did not author them.

That boundary is no longer stable.

---

## A Structural Shift in Authority

Today, a non-state actor can operate a complete governance structure.

A company, a formal language, or even an autonomous agent
can instantiate systems that include:

- liability allocation,
- insurance mechanisms,
- regulatory interfaces,
- and executable governance logic.

These systems do not merely comply with institutions.
They **run them**.

The capacity to author institutional behavior
is no longer exclusive to the state.

---

## The Category Problem

This produces a categorical tension.

If an actor can:
- define roles and permissions,
- enforce responsibility boundaries,
- interface with regulators,
- and execute governance continuously,

then the activity exceeds classical definitions of entrepreneurship.

Entrepreneurship presupposes a pre-existing institutional frame.
Here, the frame itself is being written.

## Beyond Economic Activity

What is being constructed is not only an economic entity.

It is a functional governance body:
- capable of rule execution,
- capable of accountability attribution,
- capable of interfacing with public authority,
- and capable of persisting beyond individual actors.

This raises a non-trivial question.

---

## A Political Question, Without Resolution

If institutional logic can be authored and executed
by companies, languages, or agents,

are we still describing entrepreneurship?

Or are we witnessing the emergence of a new kind of political body —
neither state nor firm,
but something structurally adjacent to both?

This position does not resolve the question.

It marks the point where economic categories
and political categories begin to overlap
under conditions of executable governance.

---

## Why This Matters

Once institutional authorship becomes technically feasible:

- governance ceases to be purely declarative,
- regulation becomes executable,
- and legitimacy must be reconsidered as an operational property.

The distinction between “building a company”
and “building an institution”
can no longer be taken for granted.

---

## Relation to Semantic Systems

This question emerges only under specific technical conditions.

Executable semantic systems make it possible for
rules, roles, and responsibility
to be operational rather than symbolic.

*Semantic OS* describes the operating environment
in which such systems can persist.

*AI-Native Management* describes how organizations behave
once execution is no longer exclusively human.

This position addresses **who** is now capable
of writing institutions at all.

## Status

This page states a position.

It does not propose a doctrine,
nor argue for legitimacy.

It marks an emerging structural condition
and leaves its political interpretation open.

---

*Note*:  
This position is formulated at the **pre-institutional evaluation layer**.
It assesses whether market structures
are sufficiently institutionalized
to support conventional economic measurement.
