SaaS was the dominant service syntax of the previous generation.

Its default assumptions were stable:
- a human user,
- a graphical interface,
- and workflow interaction mediated by screens.

That interface assumption is no longer stable.

As AI agents become operational actors,
services must become legible and executable to non-human users.

---

## Core Position

**Service-as-Agent-Service** treats service not as an application surface,
but as a structural unit that can be:

- parsed,
- authorized,
- invoked,
- delegated,
- composed,
- and audited by agents.

This is not “SaaS with AI,”
and it is not automation via prompts.

It is service as a machine-operable institution fragment.

---

## Structural Requirements

A Service-as-Agent-Service must support:

### 1. Parsability

The service boundary must be machine-readable.

Like:
- HTML defining a document surface,
- PEPPOL defining interoperable procurement exchange,

Service-as-Agent-Service defines service surfaces
that agents can interpret without UI conventions.

---

### 2. Authorizability

Invocation must carry explicit authority constraints.

A service must expose:
- what may be executed,
- under which roles,
- within which scopes,
- with what traceability.

Authorization is part of the service syntax,
not an external policy appendix.

---

### 3. Executability

The service must be runnable as structured action,
not merely describable as intent.

Execution must admit:
- state tracking,
- completion confirmation,
- failure modes,
- and escalation routes.

---

### 4. Composability

Services must compose without fragile prompt glue.

Composition requires:
- stable schemas,
- bounded semantics,
- and predictable interfaces across agent contexts.

---

## Applied Verification

We are testing this structure in applied domains
where accountability and traceability are non-negotiable:

- accounting,
- and fitness coaching operations.

The verification focus is whether agents can:

1. decompose and delegate tasks,
2. track state and confirm delivery,
3. enforce schema-level execution constraints and policy.

These are not feature tests.
They are structural tests.

---

## Why This Matters

SaaS assumed humans clicking forms.

Service-as-Agent-Service assumes agents operating execution structures.

This is not an application category shift.
It is a governance boundary shift:
services become institutional skeletons—
units through which responsibility and legitimacy can be operationalized.

## Status

This page states a position.

Implementation notes and applied results
are documented separately as field notes and research artifacts.

Service-as-Agent-Service is a structural category proposal,
not a product pitch.
