title: Positions

This section articulates positions derived from a specific set of architectural assumptions about language, execution, and AI.

These assumptions are not restated in full here and summarized below and treated as non-negotiable throughout the following work.

1. **Natural language is an executable input**, not merely an interface.
2. **Execution requires an intermediate semantic structure** that is inspectable and verifiable.
3. **Agents are accountable actors**, not workflow abstractions.
4. **AI enters institutions before it enters products at scale.**
5. **Standards are engineering artifacts**, not external constraints.
6. **High-friction domains are primary validation environments**.
7. **Agent execution presupposes persistent identity and semantic stability.**

Readers unfamiliar with these assumptions may wish to consult [*Foundational assumptions*](/perspectives/foundations/working-assumptions) before proceeding.

For an overview of how these positions relate, see [Overview: Executable Semantic Order](/overview/executable-semantic-order/).
