title: Positions
aliases:

This section articulates positions derived from a specific set of architectural assumptions about language, execution, and AI.

These assumptions are not restated in full here and summarized below and treated as non-negotiable throughout the following work.

1. **Natural language is an executable input**, not merely an interface.
2. **Execution requires an intermediate semantic structure** that is inspectable and verifiable.
3. **Agents are accountable actors**, not workflow abstractions.
4. **AI enters institutions before it enters products at scale.**
5. **Standards are engineering artifacts**, not external constraints.
6. **High-friction domains are primary validation environments**.
7. **Agent execution presupposes persistent identity and semantic stability.**

Readers unfamiliar with these assumptions may wish to consult [*Foundational assumptions*](/perspectives/foundations/working-assumptions) before proceeding.

For an overview of how these positions relate, see [Overview: Executable Semantic Order](/overview/executable-semantic-order/).

## Operating Context

The current execution environment for these positions is cross-border trade.

This domain functions as a high-friction testbed for validating accountable AI workforce systems under real regulatory, jurisdictional, and economic constraints.

While individual positions may address governance, execution, or institutional design in isolation, they are developed and tested within a broader objective: the construction of **AI Workforce Infrastructure**—foundational systems that allow organizations to deploy, govern, and audit AI workforces as part of their core operations.

Cross-border trade provides the conditions necessary to stress-test these assumptions without prematurely constraining the architecture to a single industry or product form.
