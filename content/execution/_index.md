title: "Execution"
description: "How semantic intent enters constrained, accountable execution."
---

## Scope

This execution model applies to systems where semantic intent
initiates actions with persistent effects and delegated responsibility.

It does not address advisory, assistive, or non-consequential outputs.

---

## Execution Chain

Semantic intent is not executable by default.

Execution proceeds only after:
1. admissibility is established
2. intent is transformed into constrained instructions
3. execution produces traceable effects

Once execution begins, rollback is no longer guaranteed.

---

## Failure and Responsibility

Execution failure is not a model issue.

Failure is classified as:
- semantic inadmissibility
- structural interruption
- responsibility discontinuity

Each failure mode requires explicit handling
before execution is permitted.

---

## Enables / Refuses

This execution model enables:
- auditable task completion
- responsibility transfer across agents
- replayable execution traces

It explicitly refuses:
- implicit execution
- silent side effects
- best-effort completion without accountability
