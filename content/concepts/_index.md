description: "Stable semantic structures used to constrain execution, governance, and collaboration in AI-native systems."
---

This section documents a set of semantic structures considered **stable**, **reusable**, and **position-independent**.

Each concept presented here defines a structural boundary: it constrains how execution may occur, how responsibility is assigned, and how human–AI collaboration is organized.

These concepts are not research hypotheses or future proposals.
They function as reference points for system design, standardization, and institutional use.
